For important messages, draft thoughtful, complete responses that address all questions or concerns raised. Use templates for common inquiries to save time, but personalize each message. Keep responses clear, concise, and action-oriented with specific next steps or timelines. If a message requires significant time to address properly, send a quick acknowledgment and schedule dedicated time to provide a comprehensive response. Set up email filters and labels to automatically organize incoming messages. Use the two-minute rule: if a response takes less than two minutes, do it immediately rather than adding to your task list. For messages that generate new tasks, immediately add them to your action item list with appropriate priority and deadline. End the day with inbox zero or a clearly organized inbox where all messages are categorized and have scheduled response times.\n"

      "instructions": "Begin by accessing the centralized manager streams tracking table where all manager broadcast activities are logged. This table should include columns for manager name, stream date/time, topic covered, attendance numbers, engagement metrics, and your detailed comments section. Review the table to identify which manager streams need comment updates, prioritizing recent streams from the past week that haven't been documented yet. For each manager stream that needs review, watch the recorded session (if available) or gather information from live notes, attendance records, and engagement metrics. Create a standardized evaluation framework that assesses multiple dimensions of manager performance including: content quality and accuracy, presentation skills and delivery style, technical proficiency with streaming tools, ability to engage and interact with audience, time management and pacing, handling of questions and discussions, preparation and organization, visual aids and materials quality, energy and enthusiasm level, clarity of explanations, and professional demeanor. As you watch each stream, take detailed notes organized by these categories. Note specific timestamps for particularly strong moments or areas needing improvement (e.g., \"Excellent explanation of concept at 15:30\" or \"Audio quality issues between 22:00-25:00\"). Evaluate student/participant engagement by reviewing chat activity, questions asked, attendance duration, and any post-stream feedback or survey results. Identify patterns such as when audience engagement peaks or drops, which topics generate most interaction, and how effectively the manager responds to questions. Document technical issues comprehensively including audio/video quality problems, connectivity issues, screen sharing difficulties, platform glitches, or any technical interruptions that affected the stream quality. Note whether these were manager errors or system issues beyond their control. Recognize and document successful techniques and best practices demonstrated by each manager. These might include effective icebreakers, engaging teaching methods, creative use of polls or interactive features, excellent storytelling, real-world examples that resonate with audience, or innovative approaches to complex topics. Draft comments that are specific, constructive, and balanced. Avoid vague statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Instead write specific observations such as: \"Strong opening that immediately captured attention by relating topic to current industry trends. Consider adding more visual examples when explaining technical concepts as audience engagement dropped slightly during the theoretical section (35:00-42:00). Excellent handling of the challenging question at 1:05:00 - turned it into a great learning moment for everyone.\" Structure your comments to include: opening positive observation, specific areas of strength with examples, constructive suggestions for improvement with actionable steps, technical or logistical notes, overall assessment, and any support or resources that might help the manager improve. Maintain a professional, supportive tone even when addressing significant concerns. Frame feedback as opportunities for growth rather than criticism. Use language like \"Consider exploring...\" or \"An opportunity to enhance...\" rather than \"You failed to...\" or \"This was wrong.\" For managers showing consistent excellence, provide specific praise and consider highlighting their streams as examples for others. Document innovative approaches or particularly effective segments that could be shared as best practices with the team. For managers struggling with specific aspects, note whether this is a one-time issue or recurring pattern. Identify whether they need additional training, technical support, mentoring, or resources. Be specific about support recommendations such as \"Would benefit from training on interactive polling features\" or \"Might need upgraded microphone equipment for better audio quality.\" Ensure all comments are entered in the appropriate cells of the tracking table with consistent formatting. If the table has character limits, write full detailed comments in a separate document and include key summary points in the table with a reference to the full feedback document. Include quantitative data where available to support your qualitative observations: attendance numbers, average viewing duration, engagement rate (comments/questions per attendee), satisfaction scores if surveys were conducted, and comparison to previous streams to show improvement trends. Tag or flag streams that require immediate attention or follow-up action, such as urgent technical issues that need resolution, content concerns that need correction, or exceptional performance that should be recognized formally. If your organization has a formal feedback schedule, coordinate your comment additions with one-on-one feedback sessions with managers. Share your documented observations during these meetings, allowing for discussion and collaborative development of improvement plans. Maintain historical tracking of comments over time to identify patterns, track improvement trajectories, and provide evidence for performance evaluations. Regular review of past comments helps ensure feedback is having desired impact and managers are progressing. Set up a regular cadence for reviewing and commenting on manager streams - for example, all streams from the previous week should have detailed comments added by Monday of the following week. Consistency ensures timely feedback when experiences are still fresh. Consider creating a rating or scoring system alongside detailed comments to allow for quick visual assessment of manager performance trends over time. This could include numerical ratings for key categories (1-5 scale) plus your detailed written comments. Collaborate with other team members who may have observed the same streams to gather multiple perspectives before finalizing comments. Different observers may notice different strengths or concerns, creating more comprehensive feedback. Before finalizing all comments, review for tone and clarity. Ensure feedback is professional, constructive, specific, actionable, balanced (noting both strengths and growth areas), and free from personal bias or subjective judgments unrelated to performance. After adding comments to the tracking table, follow up with individual managers as appropriate based on your organization's feedback protocols. Some comments may be for record-keeping only, while significant concerns or exceptional performance may warrant direct conversation. Document any follow-up actions, training scheduled, or improvement plans in the tracking table alongside your comments to provide complete record of manager development journey.",

This table should include columns for manager name, stream date/time, topic covered, attendance numbers, engagement metrics, and your detailed comments section. Review the table to identify which manager streams need comment updates, prioritizing recent streams from the past week that haven't been documented yet. For each manager stream that needs review, watch the recorded session (if available) or gather information from live notes, attendance records, and engagement metrics. Create a standardized evaluation framework that assesses multiple dimensions of manager performance including: content quality and accuracy, presentation skills and delivery style, technical proficiency with streaming tools, ability to engage and interact with audience, time management and pacing, handling of questions and discussions, preparation and organization, visual aids and materials quality, energy and enthusiasm level, clarity of explanations, and professional demeanor. As you watch each stream, take detailed notes organized by these categories. Note specific timestamps for particularly strong moments or areas needing improvement (e.g., \"Excellent explanation of concept at 15:30\" or \"Audio quality issues between 22:00-25:00\"). Evaluate student/participant engagement by reviewing chat activity, questions asked, attendance duration, and any post-stream feedback or survey results. Identify patterns such as when audience engagement peaks or drops, which topics generate most interaction, and how effectively the manager responds to questions. Document technical issues comprehensively including audio/video quality problems, connectivity issues, screen sharing difficulties, platform glitches, or any technical interruptions that affected the stream quality. Note whether these were manager errors or system issues beyond their control. Recognize and document successful techniques and best practices demonstrated by each manager. These might include effective icebreakers, engaging teaching methods, creative use of polls or interactive features, excellent storytelling, real-world examples that resonate with audience, or innovative approaches to complex topics. Draft comments that are specific, constructive, and balanced. Avoid vague statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Instead write specific observations such as: \"Strong opening that immediately captured attention by relating topic to current industry trends. Consider adding more visual examples when explaining technical concepts as audience engagement dropped slightly during the theoretical section (35:00-42:00). Excellent handling of the challenging question at 1:05:00 - turned it into a great learning moment for everyone.\" Structure your comments to include: opening positive observation, specific areas of strength with examples, constructive suggestions for improvement with actionable steps, technical or logistical notes, overall assessment, and any support or resources that might help the manager improve. Maintain a professional, supportive tone even when addressing significant concerns. Frame feedback as opportunities for growth rather than criticism. Use language like \"Consider exploring...\" or \"An opportunity to enhance...\" rather than \"You failed to...\" or \"This was wrong.\" For managers showing consistent excellence, provide specific praise and consider highlighting their streams as examples for others. Document innovative approaches or particularly effective segments that could be shared as best practices with the team. For managers struggling with specific aspects, note whether this is a one-time issue or recurring pattern. Identify whether they need additional training, technical support, mentoring, or resources. Be specific about support recommendations such as \"Would benefit from training on interactive polling features\" or \"Might need upgraded microphone equipment for better audio quality.\" Ensure all comments are entered in the appropriate cells of the tracking table with consistent formatting. If the table has character limits, write full detailed comments in a separate document and include key summary points in the table with a reference to the full feedback document. Include quantitative data where available to support your qualitative observations: attendance numbers, average viewing duration, engagement rate (comments/questions per attendee), satisfaction scores if surveys were conducted, and comparison to previous streams to show improvement trends. Tag or flag streams that require immediate attention or follow-up action, such as urgent technical issues that need resolution, content concerns that need correction, or exceptional performance that should be recognized formally. If your organization has a formal feedback schedule, coordinate your comment additions with one-on-one feedback sessions with managers. Share your documented observations during these meetings, allowing for discussion and collaborative development of improvement plans. Maintain historical tracking of comments over time to identify patterns, track improvement trajectories, and provide evidence for performance evaluations. Regular review of past comments helps ensure feedback is having desired impact and managers are progressing.
