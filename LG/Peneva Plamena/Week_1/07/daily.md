## Activities

### [12:50] - [Call with Frank]
**Quick Call with Frank for the sheet:**
- We checked the sheets together and he told me which archives I should combine in one 
- After that we decided to have a quick call before the end of my shift so we can check them again 

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Check what it is. Is there a link? Yes, check concentration. It's a beautiful museum. Just make it okay, so I will remove this one. This is like everywhere. Not so. If I see this in other sheets and tables, it's the same again. Right? When you click on the link, sometimes to see the OK. OK. And for instance, can you put them at Chronos? Yes. Line 54 is Chronos, and then this Danish museum. And the ones which don't have a website, you just Google them and put the website in there if you can find it. If you don't of course not. You can also mark if you are not sure and then I can go through. Ok, ok, I'll go ahead and get that service 
Yeah okay, you just go through the whatever whatever you find. I'm checking all the tables for instance line 104 is also the National Museum in Hungary I think. So at least a second NFE. I think it's all the same website just different spellings. We have a better overview and we have to really keep this table up to date. One of the next steps is that we add the prices but yeah still continue this first. I have now at 12 I have a call with Anastasia; she wanted to have a review after one month. We still have to do a lot of work obviously. You have a call I think with the team today? With the whole team? And with you also. And I don't know. I don't know how it just-- I'm just asking because I probably will finish with this one. So maybe after the call we can check it together again. The table? With the archives? But you mean the team of from Fact and Files? I just saw it in the group that you will have a call. Yeah. I mean if you want you can just join also? 
Ok you can text me when you finish with the meeting

### [Time] - [Activity Name]
**2nd meeting:**
- 

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Hey, hey, hi, hello? Hi, can you hear me? Yes I can hear you. Oh great. Yeah sorry I was just in a meeting until now and actually I have to leave already. Yeah just five minutes and then I should leave. Okay yeah I'm still working on the sheet cleaning up. Also some of the archive names were as you told me to check the websites. There were some different names but the same websites. For example we had Hungarian National Digital Archive and Film Institute and the website was the same as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This can be because sometimes the Holocaust Memorial Museum has the films which are used which are coming from the Hungarian. But it should not be on this list in the link list. It can be. So it has to be corrected to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Yeah yeah there are a lot of films which are actually belonging to different archives. I changed it that's why I wanted to ask you where did you change it? I think it was in a low one but I already changed it so let me see in the cup. Can you see my screen? Let me just show you. I think it was here. Yeah it's here. So let me go to the link. Not change it. Yeah because this is the link to the actual film but the film is coming from the Hungarian National Archive. So here you definitely should not change to you in United States Holocaust Memorial museum but to keep it as Hungarian whatever. Now okay. That's why I wanted to ask you because I was not sure. Yeah no there is only some which are most I guess most of them. I mean there's some United States Holocaust Memorial Museum which are actually films which they own but many they don't own. Yeah okay. Also combined the things that you told me. I think yeah this one we have only one now. I think everything that it sits just turning out really cool because even here it's correct. But I'm taking it one by one here because we have some extra space or I just lowercases. Yes, that's fine. I have to go, you can continue with this task and we'll talk again on Monday. Have a nice weekend. Have a nice weekend as well, bye.
