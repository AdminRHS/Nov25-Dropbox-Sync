# ERROR IN RE EXTENSION

Please take a look at the attached screenshots for reference.

When you’re adding a new lead through ReExtension (under the “Add New Lead” button), make sure that your full name and the account you’re working from are displayed correctly.

If your name don’t appear, please:
1️⃣ Log out from ReExtension.
2️⃣ Go to Manage Extensions → find ReExtension.
3️⃣ Click on “Errors” and fix them if any appear.
4️⃣ Log back into ReExtension and check that everything works correctly.

If you’ve already added companies without your name/account showing, please open those cards manually, click Edit, and link your account correctly.

Thanks for paying attention to this — it’s really important for tracking everyone’s work properly! ✅

# INTERESTED DEEPRES
1️⃣ When a lead is interested, go to the New Message Templates sheet and fill it out — same as before.
Make sure to include the lgManager name — this is important.

2️⃣ In the same sheet, tick the Interested column. 
Once you do this, the Deep Research process will start automatically.
You can track the progress in the dr_status column:
in progress → means it’s running
done → means it’s completed
⚠️ Do not touch or edit the dr_status column — it updates automatically

3️⃣ When it’s done, you’ll find your Deep Research file in the Shared Drive folder on Google Drive.

We only fill out this sheet when the lead is interested in our services.

After that, continue as usual: use the research to create your message and reply to the lead.
