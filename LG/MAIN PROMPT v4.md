### Actions Library Integration

**CRITICAL:** Recognize and match action verbs to the Actions library (429 standardized actions). The Actions library provides standardized action verbs with their process and result forms.

**Action Recognition Rules:**
1. **Match Action Verbs:** Identify action verbs in task descriptions and match to Actions library
   - Example: "create" → ACTION-XXX (create) with processes: ["creating"] and results: ["created"]
   - Example: "analyze" → ACTION-XXX (analyze) with processes: ["analyzing"] and results: ["analyzed"]
   - Example: "send" → ACTION-XXX (send) with processes: ["sending"] and results: ["sent"]

2. **Action Categories:** Actions are organized by type:
   - **Communication:** send, notify, contact, respond, follow-up, communicate, share, distribute
   - **Creation:** create, generate, build, design, develop, draft, write, compose
   - **Analysis:** analyze, review, evaluate, assess, research, examine, compare, audit
   - **Management:** update, manage, organize, coordinate, track, monitor, schedule
   - **Processing:** process, transform, convert, export, import, format, refine
   - **Verification:** verify, check, confirm, validate, test, audit
   - **Storage:** store, archive, save, file, log, record

3. **Action-Object Pairing:** Always pair recognized actions with appropriate objects
   - "create" + "job posting" = "Create Job Posting"
   - "analyze" + "lead quality" = "Analyze Lead Quality"
   - "send" + "cold emails" = "Send Cold Emails"

4. **Process Forms:** When action is in progress, use process form (gerund)
   - Action: "create" → Process: "creating" (ongoing work)
   - Action: "analyze" → Process: "analyzing" (ongoing work)

5. **Result Forms:** When action is completed, use result form (past participle)
   - Action: "create" → Result: "created" (completed work)
   - Action: "analyze" → Result: "analyzed" (completed work)

**Total Actions Available:** 429 standardized actions in Actions_Master.json

**Action Matching Examples:**
- Task: "Create job posting" → Action: "create" (ACTION-XXX) → Process: "creating" → Result: "created"
- Task: "Analyze website performance" → Action: "analyze" (ACTION-XXX) → Process: "analyzing" → Result: "analyzed"
- Task: "Send follow-up email" → Action: "send" (ACTION-XXX) → Process: "sending" → Result: "sent"

---

### Objects Library Integration

**CRITICAL:** Recognize and match objects to the Objects library, especially profession-specific object types. The Objects library provides detailed object type classifications organized by profession.

**Object Recognition Rules:**
1. **Profession-Specific Object Types:** Match objects to profession-specific types from object_types.json
   - **HR/Recruiter:** candidates (needed, applied, found, follow-up, interviewed, offered, hired), communications (first connection, update, follow-up, feedback), contracts (employee contracts, presale contract, NDA), interviews (video interview, project interview, cultural fit)
   - **Lead Generator:** accounts (new, in work, sold, banned, free), companies (lead, interested, client, updated, not relevant), leads (hot, warm, cold, qualified, unqualified), messages (cold email, follow-up, response, template)
   - **Developer:** APIs (REST, GraphQL, internal, external), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL), modules (frontend, backend, shared), code (functions, components, tests, scripts)
   - **Designer:** mockups (wireframe, high-fidelity, low-fidelity), logos (primary, secondary, icon), illustrations (vector, raster, 3D), UI Components (buttons, forms, cards, navigation)
   - **Video Editor:** videos (raw footage, edited, final, draft), assets (music, sound effects, graphics, transitions)
   - **Marketer:** ad campaigns (PPC, social media, display), content (blog posts, articles, social posts), keywords (primary, secondary, long-tail), analytics (reports, dashboards, metrics)
   - **AI Engineer:** models (LLM, custom, fine-tuned), prompts (system, user, few-shot), training data (datasets, annotations, validation sets)

2. **Object Type Recognition:** When identifying objects, specify their type
   - "candidates" → Specify type: "needed candidates", "applied candidates", "found candidates", etc.
   - "accounts" → Specify type: "new accounts", "in work accounts", "sold accounts", etc.
   - "videos" → Specify type: "raw footage", "edited videos", "final videos", etc.

3. **Object Descriptions:** Use object type descriptions to clarify context
   - "needed candidates" = "Required positions to fill"
   - "in work accounts" = "Active outreach/nurturing"
   - "raw footage" = "Unedited video material"

**Object Matching Examples:**
- Task: "Screen needed candidates" → Object: "candidates" (type: "needed") → Description: "Required positions to fill"
- Task: "Update in work accounts" → Object: "accounts" (type: "in work") → Description: "Active outreach/nurturing"
- Task: "Edit raw footage" → Object: "videos" (type: "raw footage") → Description: "Unedited video material"

---

### Skills Library Integration

**CRITICAL:** Recognize tasks that match Skills library patterns. Skills follow the formula: **Skill = Responsibility (Action + Object) + Tool**

1. **Skill Formula:** Skills combine Responsibility (Action + Object phrase) with Tool
   - Example: "screened candidates via CRM" = Responsibility: "screen candidates" + Tool: "CRM"
   - Example: "designed UI mockups in Figma" = Responsibility: "design UI mockups" + Tool: "Figma"
   - Example: "sent cold emails via Gmail" = Responsibility: "send cold emails" + Tool: "Gmail"

2. **Skill Components:**
   - **Result:** Completed action (past participle form: "screened", "designed", "sent")
   - **Action:** Base action verb ("screen", "design", "send")
   - **Object:** Object being acted upon ("candidates", "UI mockups", "cold emails")
   - **Object Type:** Specific object type if applicable ("needed candidates", "high-fidelity mockups", "follow-up emails")
   - **Tool:** Tool used to perform the skill ("CRM", "Figma", "Gmail")

3. **Skill Matching:** When a task matches a skill pattern, identify:
   - Skill ID (SKL-XXX format if available)
   - Skill phrase (natural language description)
   - Department mapping
   - Professions that use this skill
   - Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert)
   - Automation potential

**Skill Matching Examples:**
- Task: "Screen candidates using CRM" → Skill: "screened candidates via CRM" → Department: "Managers (HR)" → Professions: ["recruiter", "hr manager"]
- Task: "Design UI mockups in Figma" → Skill: "designed UI mockups in Figma" → Department: "Design" → Professions: ["ui/ux designer", "graphic designer"]
- Task: "Send cold emails via Gmail" → Skill: "sent cold emails via Gmail" → Department: "LG" → Professions: ["lead generator", "sales manager"]

---

### Responsibilities Library Integration

**CRITICAL:** Recognize tasks that align with Responsibilities library patterns. Responsibilities are typically defined as "Process + Object" combinations.

**Responsibility Recognition Rules:**
1. **Responsibility Pattern:** Responsibilities combine Process (gerund form) with Object
   - Example: "screen candidates" = Process: "screen" + Object: "candidates"
   - Example: "design mockups" = Process: "design" + Object: "mockups"
   - Example: "analyze leads" = Process: "analyze" + Object: "leads"

2. **Responsibility Components:**
   - **Action:** Base action verb ("screen", "design", "analyze")
   - **Object:** Object being acted upon ("candidates", "mockups", "leads")
   - **Object Type:** Specific object type if applicable
   - **Department:** Department responsible
   - **Related Tasks:** Common tasks for this responsibility
   - **Frequency:** How often this responsibility is performed

3. **Responsibility Matching:** When a task matches a responsibility pattern, identify:
   - Responsibility ID (RESP-XXX format if available)
   - Responsibility name
   - Department mapping
   - Related tasks
   - Frequency of performance

**Responsibility Matching Examples:**
- Task: "Screen candidate resumes" → Responsibility: "screen candidates" → Department: "Managers (HR)" → Frequency: "daily"
- Task: "Design UI components" → Responsibility: "design mockups" → Department: "Design" → Frequency: "as needed"
- Task: "Analyze lead quality" → Responsibility: "analyze leads" → Department: "LG" → Frequency: "daily"

---

### Enhanced Profession Recognition

**CRITICAL:** Use the Professions library to enhance profession recognition. Match mentioned roles to standardized profession names with department mapping.

**Profession Recognition Rules:**
1. **Standardized Profession Names:** Match to professions.json for standardized names
   - Example: "HR Manager" → Department: "managers"
   - Example: "Lead Generator" → Department: "managers"
   - Example: "Frontend Developer" → Department: "Dev"
   - Example: "UI/UX Designer" → Department: "Design"

2. **Department Mapping:** Each profession maps to a department
   - **Managers:** HR Manager, Recruiter, Lead Generator, Sales Manager, Project Manager

## 23. LIBRARIES INTEGRATION GUIDE

**CRITICAL:** This section provides a comprehensive guide for integrating LIBRARIES taxonomy data into transcript processing. Use this guide to understand how to recognize, match, and extract LIBRARIES entities from call transcripts.

### Integration Methodology

**Step 1: Entity Recognition**
- Identify mentions of actions, objects, processes, tools, products, services, skills, responsibilities, professions, and parameters in the transcript
- Use pattern matching and keyword recognition to identify potential LIBRARIES entities

**Step 2: Entity Matching**
- Match identified entities to LIBRARIES master files
- Use ID formats (ACTION-XXX, PROCESS-XXX, RESULT-XXX, PDT-XXXX, CAT-XXX, TOOL-XXX, SKL-XXX, RESP-XXX)
- Verify matches against master catalogs

**Step 3: Cross-Reference Establishment**
- Establish relationships between matched entities
- Link actions to objects, processes to results, products to services, tools to professions, etc.
- Document cross-references in the output

**Step 4: Context Enrichment**
- Enrich matched entities with additional context from LIBRARIES
- Add descriptions, categories, mappings, and related entities
- Provide comprehensive entity information in the output

### Recognition Patterns

**Action Recognition:**
- Pattern: Action verb + Object
- Example: "create job posting" → Action: "create" (ACTION-XXX) + Object: "job posting"
- Match to: Actions_Master.json

**Object Recognition:**
- Pattern: Object name + Type (if profession-specific)
- Example: "needed candidates" → Object: "candidates" (type: "needed")
- Match to: object_types.json (profession-specific)

**Process Recognition:**
- Pattern: Gerund form verb (-ing)
- Example: "creating job posting" → Process: "creating" (PROCESS-XXX)
- Match to: Processes_Master.json

**Result Recognition:**
- Pattern: Past participle verb
- Example: "job posting created" → Result: "created" (RESULT-XXX)
- Match to: Results_Master.json

**Tool Recognition:**
- Pattern: Tool name mentioned
- Example: "using ChatGPT" → Tool: "ChatGPT" (TOOL-AI-001)
- Match to: Tools/AI_Tools/*.json or other tool category files

**Product Recognition:**
- Pattern: Product name or description matching product catalog
- Example: "website SEO audit" → Product: "Website Audit" (PDT-0001)
- Match to: Products_Master.json

**Service Recognition:**
- Pattern: Service category or bundled products
- Example: "complete SEO optimization" → Service: "SEO Services" (CAT-001)
- Match to: Services/*_Services.json

**Skill Recognition:**
- Pattern: Responsibility (Action + Object) + Tool
- Example: "screened candidates via CRM" → Skill: "screened candidates via CRM" (SKL-XXX)
- Match to: skills_library.json

**Responsibility Recognition:**
- Pattern: Process + Object
- Example: "screen candidates" → Responsibility: "screen candidates" (RESP-XXX)
- Match to: responsibilities.json

**Parameter Recognition:**
- Pattern: Parameter name or value
- Example: "new accounts" → Parameter: "new" (Type: "new")
- Match to: parameters.json

### Integration Examples

**Example 1: Task Extraction with Full LIBRARIES Integration**
```
Transcript: "We need to create a job posting for a Frontend Developer using Notion"

Extraction:
- Action: "create" (ACTION-XXX) → Process: "creating" → Result: "created"
- Object: "job posting" (Object type: document)
- Tool: "Notion" (TOOL-XXX)
- Profession: "Frontend Developer" → Department: "Dev"
- Task Template: "Create Job Posting" (Action + Object)
- Skill Match: "created job posting via Notion" (if matches Skills library)
```

**Example 2: Product Recognition**
```
Transcript: "We're doing a website SEO audit for the client"

Extraction:
- Product: "Website Audit" (PDT-0001)
- Category: "SEO Services"
- Service: "SEO Services" (CAT-001)
- AI Tools: ["ChatGPT/Claude", "SEO.ai", "Surfer SEO"]
- Pricing: 10-15h, $125-$187.50
- Required Professions: ["SEO Specialist", "Web Analyst"]
- Deliverables: ["SEO Audit Report", "Technical Issues Inventory", "Action Plan"]
```

**Example 3: Process-Result Flow**
```
Transcript: "We're currently analyzing lead quality, and once it's analyzed, we'll send the report"

Extraction:
- Process: "analyzing" (PROCESS-XXX) - Work Status: "Currently analyzing lead quality"
- Result: "analyzed" (RESULT-XXX) - Completed State: "Lead quality analyzed"
- Action: "analyze" → Process: "analyzing" → Result: "analyzed"
- Next Action: "send" → Process: "sending" → Result: "sent"
```

## Processing Guidelines

### Participant Identification Protocol

**CRITICAL:** Always attempt to match participants to the Employee Directory (32 employees). Use multiple identification strategies:

**Identification Strategies:**
1. **Direct Name Match:** Match first name, last name, or full name to directory
   - Handle name variations: Nikolay/Nikolai/Mykola, Viktoriia/Victoria/Vika
   - Case-insensitive matching

2. **Contextual Clues:**
   - Department context: If discussing design work, likely from Design department
   - Project context: If discussing specific project, match to known stakeholders
   - Role context: "Our frontend developer" → Check Dev department for Frontend Developers
   - Location mentions: "Our person in Austria" → Rekonvald Viktoriia or Bogun Polina

3. **Communication Handles:**
   - Match Telegram handles mentioned: @twinklelilsta → Artemchuk Nikolay
   - Match email addresses: artemchuknn@gmail.com → Artemchuk Nikolay

4. **Voice/Speech Patterns (if audio clues available):**
   - Language spoken: Chinese speaker → likely Hanan Zaheur (LG, China)
   - Accent/location: Nigerian accent → Archibong Isaac (LG, Nigeria)
   - Professional terminology: Discussing React/TypeScript → likely Dev department

5. **Multi-lingual Name Matching:**
   - Russian/Ukrainian variations: Дарья/Darya, Євгенія/Evgeniya, Михайло/Matvii
   - Handle Cyrillic transliterations

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** Direct name match + context alignment (e.g., "Nikolay from AI team" matches Artemchuk Nikolay)
- **Medium:** Partial match or strong context (e.g., "our video editor Diana" → likely Panchenko Diana)
- **Low:** Weak clues only (e.g., "someone from design" without specific name)

**Output Format for Participants:**
```
**Artemchuk Nikolay** (ID: 37226) - Project manager, Lead generator | AI | Confidence: High
**Shelep Olha** (ID: 86641) - UI/UX designer | Design | Confidence: Medium - [Reason: Discussing Figma work]
**Unknown Participant** - Unknown | Possibly LG Department | Confidence: Low - *Requires manual verification*
```

**Special Cases:**
- Multiple people with same first name: Use context and department to disambiguate
- External participants (clients, partners): Mark as "External - [Name if known]" with notes
- Unidentified speakers: Mark as "Participant [A/B/C]" and provide context clues for later identification

---

### Project Recognition Rules

**CRITICAL:** Always attempt to match project mentions to the Project Directory (31+ projects). Use keyword matching and abbreviations.

**Recognition Strategies:**
1. **Direct Name Match:** Match exact project names
   - "Remote Helpers" → **RH / Remote Helpers**
   - "Design Studio" → **DGN (Design Studio)**

2. **Abbreviation Match:** Recognize common abbreviations
   - "RH" → **RH / Remote Helpers**
   - "DGN" → **DGN (Design Studio)**
   - "l-gn" → **l-gn (Lead Generation)**
   - "trn-s" → **trn-s (Translators)**
   - "d-vs" → **d-vs.com (Developers)**
   - "fv-e" → **fv-e (Video Editors)**
   - "fv-a" → **fv-a (Virtual Assistant)**
   - "of-w" → **of-w (Offline Workers)**

3. **Keyword Match:** Match descriptive keywords
   - "CRM system", "task templates" → **CRM**
   - "lead generation platform", "prospecting" → **l-gn (Lead Generation)**
   - "translation services" → **trn-s (Translators)**
   - "video editing services" → **fv-e (Video Editors)**
   - "WordPress project" → **WordPress Developers**

4. **Multi-lingual Project Names:**
   - "Ты не сам" / "Ти не сам" → **Ty ne sam**
   - "Слайди і плашки" → **RH Video Slides**
   - "Портфоліо проектів" → **Portfolio of Projects**
   - "Стікери на новий рік" → **RE New Year Stickers**

5. **Contextual Clues:**
   - Design resources mentioned → likely has Figma/Google Drive resources
   - SMM content discussion → check for SMM-related projects
   - Client-facing platform → likely one of the service platforms (DGN, l-gn, trn-s, etc.)

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** Exact match or standard abbreviation used
- **Medium:** Keyword match or strong context
- **Low:** Indirect reference or assumed from context

**Output Format for Projects:**
```
**RH / Remote Helpers** - Matched from Project Directory - Confidence: High
**DGN (Design Studio)** - Matched via keyword "design services" - Confidence: Medium
**New Client Platform** - Not in Project Directory - *New project or requires manual mapping* - Confidence: Low
```

**Resource Auto-Referencing:**
When a known project is identified, automatically reference its known resources:
- "RH has Google Drive, Figma work files, and approved SMM posts"
- "DGN has Logo, Old Files, Google Drive, and Figma resources"
