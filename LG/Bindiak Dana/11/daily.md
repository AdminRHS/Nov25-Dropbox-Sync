### 11:00 a.m. - 11:15 a.m. - Workflow Session
**What I worked on:**
- Had a short training session with team lead regarding new workflow format
- Asked several clarifying questions about working with old connections:
  - How many old connections I need to process each day
  - Best practices for old connections management
- Discussed whether I should separate my working accounts for different tasks:
  - Job site tasks
  - Using Google Script extension to search for companies
- Clarified workflow points and implementation strategy

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**Question 1: Account separation for Job Sites and Extension tasks**
Me: "На середу, четвер, п'ятницю — ми працюємо наполовину Job Sites, наполовину Extension. Чи треба розділяти акаунти? Один акаунт чисто Job Sites, а один акаунт чисто Extension, як ми раніше робили?"

Team Lead: "Я думаю, поки не треба, бо там же ліміт на акаунтах є. Це буде важко."

**Question 2: Old Connections - daily limit**
Me: "По Old Connections я хотіла запитатися, чи є якийсь ліміт на день, який треба виконати по них?"

Team Lead: "Немає, просто ти робиш половину дня Old Connections, і все."

Me: "Це типу просто проскролити Networks до самого початку на акаунті?"

Team Lead: "Да, да. І відправляти повідомлення зі старими даними."

**Question 3: Extension usage**
Me: "І значить Extension ми використовуємо оцей найновіший для всіх — і для Google Script, і для Job Sites?"

Team Lead: "Так, здається, так."

**Question 4: Company limit**
Me: "По компаніях: ліміт лишається такий самий денний?"

Team Lead: "Так. Дивись, Golden Connection, тобі ж зараз півдня робити. Понеділок, вівторок не враховуються. Якщо ліміт 40 компаній на день, то в понеділок, вівторок тебе 20 має бути. Так що не переживай."


**Outcomes:**
- Better understanding of new workflow format
- Clarity on daily targets for old connections processing
- Guidance received on working account organization strategy
- Questions answered regarding Google Script extension usage and account separation
- Clear direction for implementing new workflow effectively

### 1:10 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. - Training Session
**What I worked on:**
- Conducted training session for new Lead Generation Manager
- Taught how to work with messages spreadsheet ("New messages on LG account")
- Explained spreadsheet structure and required fields:
  - Company source
  - Company website
  - CRM link
  - Status
  - Lead link
- Demonstrated process of filling out spreadsheet for deep research
- Showed how to find leads in CRM system
- Explained handling CRM access issues (requesting access from team lead)
- Demonstrated deep research process using Google Gemini with proper prompts
- Taught how to generate personalized messages for positive lead responses
- Covered handling "not interested" responses with template messages
- Showed ChatGPT integration for message generation

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**Step 1: Opening and navigating the spreadsheet**
Me: "Can you please open this spreadsheet? New messages on LG account. Scroll to the very down until the last message. Choose today's date. Good, now find yourself as an agent."

**Step 2: Finding lead information**
Me: "Now we have to open the messages with the lead for who we have to generate a message. Can you open this page in the new tab? Now we have to copy her name and find her in CRM system."

**Issue: CRM access**
Trainee: "She doesn't have the access in the CRM for this card."

Me: "Can we just add manually the information in this spreadsheet, but we don't have the CRM link for this card. Can you please send this name of this lead to the Xenia team lead in private messages, so she will give you the access."

**Step 3: Working with second lead**
Me: "Let's try now with the second one, and we will come back to this one. Open his page in new tab. Let's copy his name and find him in CRM system."

**Handling "not interested" response**
Me: "What should you do with this lead? He said, 'I don't have any requirements of this kind at the moment,' so we can send him just the 'not interested' template message. In the future, we will work with him again."

**Step 4: Filling out spreadsheet information**
Me: "Let's come back to this spreadsheet with messages and see what information we need to generate a message. In the top, you can see: Company source, Company website, CRM link, Status, Lead link. We have to copy all this information from our CRM card to fill out the spreadsheet."

**Step 5: Deep research process**
Me: "For doing this manually, I will send you the prompt. You have to copy all of this and open Gemini on LG account. Google Gemini. Deep research. Now, please put all the prompts with two parts here. We have to put company name, website, and LinkedIn. Now you can send it. Start research, and now we have to wait."

**Step 6: ChatGPT integration**
Me: "Can you open please in new tab and open the GPT Chat. Can you see under the extension mark? You have like double... Can you open my ChatGPT Chat Dana?"


**Outcomes:**

- Deep research process using Gemini demonstrated with proper prompt structure
- Message generation workflow clarified
- CRM integration process and access management explained
- Different response scenarios covered ("interested" vs "not interested")
- Spreadsheet filling process mastered
