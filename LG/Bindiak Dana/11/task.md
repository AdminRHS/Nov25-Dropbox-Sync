## Task 1: Morning Setup - Creating New Day Files in Dropbox (9:00 a.m. - 9:15 a.m.)

### Steps:
1. Create new folder "11" in Dropbox (LG Nov25\Bindiak Dana\11)
2. Use Claude AI in Visual Studio Code to assist with file creation
3. Use empty folder "03" as a template reference
4. Copy templates from folder 03 to folder 11:
   - daily.md template
   - plans.md template
   - task.md template
5. Fill in plans.md for today's working day with prioritized tasks, goals, and expected outcomes

### Resources and Links:
- Folder 03 (template reference)

### Instructions:

Start the working day by creating organizational structure for the new day. Use Visual Studio Code with Claude AI to efficiently create folder 11 in Dropbox. Reference the empty folder 03 as a template to copy the three main templates (daily.md, plans.md, and task.md).

Once templates are copied to the new folder 11, fill in the plans.md file with today's prioritized tasks (Job Sites Task, Networks and Messages, Old Connections Task), goals, and expected outcomes to establish a clear roadmap for the day's work.

Time allocation: 9:00 a.m. - 9:15 a.m.

## Task 2: Job Sites Task (9:15 a.m. - 11:00 a.m., 11:15 a.m. - 1:10 p.m.)

### Steps:
1. Review job sites and identify relevant companies
2. Select target companies that match criteria
3. Use Re-E extension (new version) to add companies to CRM system
4. Open LinkedIn profiles of identified leads
5. Use SalesQL extension to collect contact information from leads' LinkedIn profiles
6. Add collected contact details to CRM system
7. Use ChatGPT and DeepL to verify job titles and company roles for accuracy
8. Send connection requests to all identified leads

### Instructions:

Start by reviewing job sites to identify relevant companies that match your target criteria. Once companies are selected, use the Re-E extension (new version, which has been tested and works efficiently) to add these companies directly to the CRM system.

For each company, identify potential leads and open their LinkedIn profiles. Use the SalesQL extension to collect contact information from their profiles. Before adding contacts to the CRM, verify job titles and company roles using ChatGPT and DeepL translation tools to ensure accuracy.

After all information is verified and added to the CRM system, send connection requests to all identified leads. This ensures a systematic approach to lead generation through job sites.

Time allocation: 9:15 a.m. - 11:00 a.m., 11:15 a.m. - 1:10 p.m. (with 15-minute break)

Explain the structure of the spreadsheet, emphasizing the importance of each field: Company source, Company website, CRM link, Status, and Lead link.

Walk through the process of opening a lead's message, copying their name, and finding them in the CRM system. If the trainee encounters CRM access issues, teach them to send the lead's name to the team lead (Xenia) in private messages to request access.

Demonstrate the deep research process using Google Gemini on the LG account. Show how to input the proper prompt with company name, website, and LinkedIn information, then start the research and wait for results.

For leads who respond positively, demonstrate how to fill out all required spreadsheet information from the CRM card and generate personalized messages. For "not interested" responses, show how to use template messages. Finally, demonstrate the ChatGPT integration using the Dana account for message generation.

### Instructions:

Systematically go through all your working LinkedIn accounts to manage new connections and messages. Start by checking for new connection requests and accepting those that are relevant.

Review contacts who have accepted your connection requests since your last check. Send the First Message Template to each newly connected contact to initiate engagement.

Check your message schedule to identify contacts who should receive their second follow-up message today. Send these second messages according to your outreach strategy.

Maintain consistent message tracking across all accounts to ensure proper follow-up and avoid duplicate or missed communications. This systematic approach ensures steady progress in your outreach campaign.

Time allocation: 3:00 p.m. - 3:40 p.m.

## Task 5: Old Connection Messages (3:40 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.)

5. Send Old Connection Message template to selected contacts
6. Track number of messages sent
7. Update statistics in daily reporting form

### Instructions:

Focus on re-engaging with existing connections in your LinkedIn network. Open your LinkedIn account and navigate to the "My Network" section to view your connections.

Scroll through your connections systematically, starting from the oldest contacts. The goal is to reconnect with contacts you haven't engaged with recently.

Use the Old Connection Message template to send re-engagement messages. This template is designed to renew relationships without being overly promotional.

Track the number of Old Connection messages you send throughout this session. Update your statistics in the daily reporting form with the count of messages sent (not responses received).

This task helps maintain and reactivate relationships with your existing network, creating opportunities from connections that may have gone dormant.

## Task 6: Training Session with Team Lead - AI Automation Project (5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.)

### Steps:
1. Discuss transition from lead generation to administrative AI project work
2. Review VS Code environment setup with Claude AI and ChatGPT extensions
3. Install and configure necessary AI extensions (ChatGPT, Claude)
4. Learn about the AI automation project scope and goals
5. Understand LinkedIn account history analysis requirements
6. Review plan for downloading LG Academy instructions
7. Discuss AI prompts for automated statistics and analysis
8. Clarify team restructuring and new role responsibilities
9. Understand next day's schedule and priorities

### Instructions:

This training session marks a significant transition from active lead generation work to administrative AI automation project work. Begin by discussing the shift in responsibilities - you will no longer be doing extensive lead generation but will focus on AI-powered automation and analysis.

Set up your development environment properly. Install both ChatGPT and Claude AI extensions in VS Code. The team lead will show you how these AI tools will be used for the project. Familiarize yourself with Cursor as well, which provides similar AI capabilities.

Understand the main project components:
1. **LG Academy Instructions**: Download all relevant instructions from the LG Academy and organize them in the instructions folder
2. **LinkedIn Account History Analysis**: Learn how to use AI prompts to analyze LinkedIn account history, including message statistics, response rates, and engagement patterns
3. **Automated Statistics System**: Build systems that track which messages get responses and identify patterns for optimization
4. **Message Generation and Optimization**: Use AI to generate and improve outreach messages based on statistical analysis

Clarify your new role in relation to team members. Anya will shift to part-time administrative work (card verification, manager discussions), while you and the team lead will focus on AI automation work full-time.

Understand that tomorrow you will not be doing lead generation. Instead, you'll be working on the AI project, with a goal to make significant progress by 2:00 p.m.

This is a gradual transition - not everything will be implemented on Monday. The team will work through each component systematically.

Time allocation: 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.
