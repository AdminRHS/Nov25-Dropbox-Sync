### 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM - Visual Code Reports Session
**What I worked on:**
- Participated in training session on Visual Studio Code reporting system
- Learned about Dropbox file structure for daily reporting (LG Nov25 folder)
- Understood the three mandatory daily files: daily.md, plans.md, and task.md
- Discussed yellow card system for incomplete reports (maximum 3 per month)
- Learned how to use Claude AI for automated report filling
- Reviewed the difference between daily logs (Whisper Flow transcripts), plans (detailed goals), and tasks (actionable items)
- Successfully tested automated filling of plans.md using Claude with Whisper Flow transcript

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**Question about Dropbox structure and file system**

Explained that there are files for each month and each day. Currently in "LG Nov25" (November 2025) folder. Each day has three files that must be filled out, otherwise you can receive a yellow card. Maximum three yellow cards allowed.

**Daily file** - Record all Whisper Flow transcripts. Multiple transcript sections available to add multiple entries throughout the day. Can copy transcript to Claude to clean it up, extract tasks, or process it further.

**Plans file** - Detailed breakdown of what you want to accomplish today in general terms.

**Task file** - More specific action items, broken down into points. For example, "unlink account" - something small that you completed but worth documenting. Can also be processed through Claude.

**Discussion about Claude integration:**
Files already have pre-built structure templates. Can copy the file, paste Whisper Flow recording of your plan, and ask Claude to format it according to the structure. Tested this approach with today's plans - Claude automatically filled everything very neatly and accurately.

**Process:** Record Whisper Flow about what you plan to do, tell Claude to fill specific file in specific folder using the provided text and existing structure.


**Outcomes:**
- Clear understanding of three-file daily reporting system structure
- Knowledge of yellow card penalty system for incomplete reports
- Learned how to leverage Claude AI for efficient report completion
- Successfully tested automated report filling with positive results
- Understanding of distinction between daily logs, plans, and tasks
- Confidence in using new Visual Studio Code reporting workflow
- Ready to implement daily reporting process independently
