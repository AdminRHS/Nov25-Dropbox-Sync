## Training Transcript

### Introduction and Account Overview

**Trainer (Anastasia):** Look, we have this account that I gave you, and it shows...

**Trainer:** So, we have this spreadsheet here. What's the thing? These old accounts, we don't have access to them because they require phone verification. So I'm going into the ones I gave you recently, these ones. This is about account distribution. I'll just show you how it works.

**Trainee (Alla):** Okay.

**Trainer:** I don't know if you have access. Of course. I can already tell you that I don't have it. Do you have the "Lead Academy" tab?

**Trainee:** I have the tab, but I just remember that, for example, when you gave me a new account and there were old connections there - people I didn't add - I couldn't even find them in the CRM either by company name or by name.

**Trainer:** Right. Yes. In Lead Account there are purely my four accounts. My Lead... you don't have your own tab, understood. I'll write it down somewhere now to give you access. Or is that not how it's done? You know, write it down.

### Granting Access to Lead Academy

**Trainer:** Well, now I'll try to give you access. I'm shocked. What, she's not here anymore? Well, like, at work.

**Trainer:** Okay, I gave access. Yes, check now. Come on, turn on the screen.

**Trainee:** Okay, one second, one second. Can you see my screen?

**Trainer:** Now you have access to Lead Account. Now you can see. Congratulations, do you see what's written?

**Trainer:** First, you have Lead Account, which contains accounts from last year. Click here.

**Trainer:** Now you can see everyone who is there. Not everyone, yes. Is this Time Square?

### Time Zone and Settings Management

**Trainer:** You just need to use it if, for example, they write to us that their tracker is off, we can change the time here so it's normal.

**Trainer:** Well, it happens that someone might write to me that I was at work but I don't have this recorded.

**Trainer:** So basically, you can search for other managers' cards.

### Navigating Between Accounts and Viewing Cards

**Trainer:** Also click on Lead Generation.

**Trainer:** Lead Test, this is Coverage Johns, I think.

**Trainer:** Yes. And here select Coverage.

**Trainer:** Oh, continue. And scroll down.

**Trainer:** Scroll more.

**Trainer:** Do you see John at the bottom?

**Trainer:** Here, yes, this one. Go, do you see his cards?

**Trainer:** And now go to Lead Test.

**Trainer:** Not Leads.

**Trainer:** Well, here it is, Lead Test.

### Country Settings Demonstration

**Trainer:** Now okay, open Discord with the new connection.

**Trainer:** Mistakes, just open it.

**Trainer:** Just opened the link, or click these irons, save it like that. I know. Yes, there is. That's it. I just showed you that you can change the country. Just close the tab completely.

**Trainee:** Okay.

**Trainer:** Nothing, yes, close everything - you have Lead Test, Lead Test open, and at the top you just have Lead.

**Trainee:** Okay. Yes. Waiting? Waiting.

**Trainer:** I'll step away for five minutes now and show you. While I have electricity, I need to do something.

### Card Deletion Procedures and Important Rules

**Trainer:** Okay, now I'll just show you. Do you see, you have a card here, for example, Coop Osta, Sweden. Yes, yes. Blah-blah-blah and then you have Action and three dots in the corner.

**Trainer:** See, you can now delete the card. Yes, yes, you couldn't before. This is when it throws this whole thing.

**Trainer:** And by the way, what did Joy do? Ah, she... we're throwing all cards to delete. If you added, for example, an irrelevant India or something else, or some duplicates, throw them to delete.

### Important Case Study: Client Status Cards

**Trainee (Radena):** I'm looking, and she threw a card to "delete". I look, and the card status is "Client". And we don't touch these statuses with Client at all.

**Trainee:** I say: "Why did you decide to delete it?" She says: "I wanted to add a new one, but it already exists in the system, so I asked to delete the old one."

**Trainee:** I say: "We don't do it that way."

**Trainer:** That's iron logic.

**Trainee:** Yes, I'll step away now.
