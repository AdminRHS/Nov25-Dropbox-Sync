- Mapped out workflow documentation approach

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**Trainee:** I want to continue working with the instructions that are in the Google documents.

**Team Lead:** Yes, I understand. And what exactly do you want to do with them?

**Trainee:** I want to sort them using Claude AI in Visual Studio Code.

**Team Lead:** That's a good idea. So you want to use AI to help organize these files?

**Trainee:** Yes, exactly. I think it will help us structure everything properly.

**Team Lead:** Okay, let's think about the next stages. First, we need to understand what we have - all these instruction files from different periods.

**Trainee:** Right, some are old, some are new, and they're all mixed together.

**Team Lead:** So the first stage would be to gather all the files together in one place and look at what we have.

**Trainee:** Yes, download everything from Google Docs to Dropbox.

**Team Lead:** Then we can use Claude to analyze them - see which ones are duplicates, which ones are outdated, and which ones we actually need.

**Trainee:** That makes sense. The AI can help us identify similar content across different files.

**Team Lead:** Exactly. After that, we need to organize them into logical categories - like onboarding materials, CRM instructions, messaging templates, research guides.

**Trainee:** And create a clear folder structure so everyone can find what they need quickly.

**Team Lead:** Right. Then for each category, we should create a README file that explains what's in that folder and how to use those instructions.

**Trainee:** Like a guide for the guides?

**Team Lead:** Exactly! It will help people navigate. And finally, we should document the whole workflow - how these instructions are used in practice, in what order, for what purposes.

**Trainee:** So it becomes a complete knowledge base for the department.

**Team Lead:** Yes, that's the goal. And with Claude helping us analyze and structure everything, it should go much faster than doing it manually.

**Trainee:** When should we start with the first stage?

**Team Lead:** We can start downloading and organizing files today. Once we have everything in one place, we'll let Claude analyze it and suggest the best categorization.

**Trainee:** Sounds like a solid plan. I'll start working on gathering all the files from Google Docs.

**Team Lead:** Perfect. Let's document each stage as we go, so we have a record of the process.

**Outcomes:**
- Established clear multi-stage plan for instructions processing project
- Decided to use Claude AI in VS Code as primary tool for analysis and organization
- Identified key stages: file gathering, duplicate detection, categorization, README creation, workflow documentation
- Started downloading instruction files from Google Docs to Dropbox
- Created foundation for comprehensive Lead Generation Department knowledge base
- Planned to document the entire process for future reference
- Set clear direction for AI-assisted documentation optimization project
