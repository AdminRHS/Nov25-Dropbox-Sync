### Instructions:

Start your morning by systematically logging into all your working LinkedIn accounts. Begin by checking for new network connection requests and processing them by accepting relevant connections.

For contacts who have accepted your previous connection requests, send the first message template to initiate engagement. Make sure to update the connection statuses in the CRM system to maintain accurate records.

Review your message schedule to identify which contacts require follow-up messages (second message templates) today. Send these follow-up messages across all working accounts according to your outreach strategy.

If you receive responses during this session, categorize them appropriately:
- For contacts proposing new meeting times or showing interest, note this for further action
- For contacts indicating they are not interested, send the "not interested" template response

Complete all CRM updates to ensure your connection and message tracking is current across all accounts. This systematic morning routine ensures consistent communication flow and proper follow-up management.
