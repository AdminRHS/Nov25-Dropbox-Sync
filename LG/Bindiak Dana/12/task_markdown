## Task 1: Morning Account Check and Follow-ups (9:00 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.)

### Steps:
1. Log into all working LinkedIn accounts
2. Check for new network connection requests on each account
3. Process and accept relevant new network connections
4. Send first message template to contacts who accepted connection requests
5. Update connection statuses in CRM system
6. Review message schedule for required follow-ups
7. Send second message templates (follow-ups) across all working accounts

### Resources and Links:
- LinkedIn accounts
- First message templates
- Second message templates
- CRM system
- "Not interested" response templates

### Instructions:

Start your morning by systematically logging into all your working LinkedIn accounts. Begin by checking for new network connection requests and processing them by accepting relevant connections.

For contacts who have accepted your previous connection requests, send the first message template to initiate engagement. Make sure to update the connection statuses in the CRM system to maintain accurate records.

Review your message schedule to identify which contacts require follow-up messages (second message templates) today. Send these follow-up messages across all working accounts according to your outreach strategy.

If you receive responses during this session, categorize them appropriately:
- For contacts proposing new meeting times or showing interest, note this for further action
- For contacts indicating they are not interested, send the "not interested" template response

Complete all CRM updates to ensure your connection and message tracking is current across all accounts. This systematic morning routine ensures consistent communication flow and proper follow-up management.

Time allocation: 9:00 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.

## Task 2: Processing Instructions Docs (9:30 a.m. – 1:00 p.m.)

### Steps:
1. Review and access all instruction documents in Google Docs
2. Evaluate which instructions are still applicable and useful for current workflows
3. Download relevant instruction documents from Google Docs to local Dropbox storage
4. Analyze the content and identify thematic categories for organization
5. Create 6 main folder categories in Lead Generation Department folder:
   - Onboarding and Training materials
   - Account and Tool Setup guides
   - CRM Operations documentation
   - Lead Research and Prospecting strategies
   - Outreach and Messaging templates
   - Calendar and Event Management procedures
6. Organize and distribute 56 instruction files across the thematic categories
7. Create comprehensive README.md file for each category folder
8. Create master INDEX.md file for overall navigation and documentation structure

### Instructions:

Begin by accessing the Google Docs folders containing all Lead Generation instruction documents. Your first task is to evaluate each document to determine its current relevance and applicability to existing workflows. Some instructions may be outdated, while others remain essential for daily operations.

Download all relevant instruction files from Google Docs to your local Dropbox storage in the Lead Generation Department folder. This creates a centralized, organized knowledge base that can be easily accessed and maintained.

As you review the documents, identify common themes and categories. Group similar instructions together conceptually. Create a logical 6-category folder structure that follows the natural workflow of lead generation work:

1. **Onboarding and Training** - for new team members
2. **Account and Tool Setup** - for technical configuration
3. **CRM Operations** - for daily data management
4. **Lead Research and Prospecting** - for finding and qualifying leads
5. **Outreach and Messaging** - for communication strategies
6. **Calendar and Event Management** - for scheduling and coordination

Distribute all 56 instruction files across these categories based on their content and purpose. Each file should be placed in the most appropriate category folder.

For each category folder, create a detailed README.md file that includes:
- Category overview and purpose
- List of documents contained in the folder
- Who should use these instructions
- When to reference these materials
- Best practices and workflows
- Quick reference guides

Finally, create a master INDEX.md file at the root of the documentation structure. This file should provide:
- Overall navigation across all 6 categories
- Quick reference table for finding specific instructions
- Role-based guides (new team members, experienced managers, team leads)
- Documentation standards and usage guidelines

This comprehensive organization establishes a solid foundation for the AI automation project and ensures the team has centralized, organized access to all Lead Generation processes and guidelines.

Time allocation: 9:30 a.m. – 1:00 p.m.

## Task 3: Instructions Analysis and Planning with Team Lead (2:00 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.)

### Steps:
1. Continue reviewing remaining instruction documents from Google Docs
2. Set up Claude AI in Visual Studio Code for file analysis and sorting
3. Use AI to analyze instruction files for content, structure, and organization
4. Conduct planning session with Team Lead to discuss next stages
5. Outline multi-stage strategy for instruction processing project:
   - Stage 1: File gathering and consolidation
   - Stage 2: AI-powered duplicate detection and quality assessment
   - Stage 3: Categorization and folder structure optimization
   - Stage 4: README documentation creation for each category
   - Stage 5: Workflow documentation and knowledge base finalization
6. Plan AI-powered analysis approach for identifying duplicates and outdated content
7. Discuss README documentation strategy and content requirements
8. Map out workflow documentation approach for practical usage guidance
9. Document the entire process and planning decisions

### Instructions:

Continue your work with the Google Docs instruction files, focusing on any remaining documents that need processing. The key advancement in this session is implementing AI-assisted analysis using Claude in Visual Studio Code.

Set up your Claude AI environment in VS Code to enable intelligent file analysis. Use the AI to help sort, analyze, and evaluate the instruction files. Claude can assist with identifying similar content across different files, suggesting optimal categorization, and detecting potential duplicates or outdated information.

Schedule and conduct a planning session with your Team Lead to map out the comprehensive strategy for the instruction processing project. This is a collaborative effort to ensure the approach is thorough and aligned with department needs.

During the planning discussion, establish a clear multi-stage process:

**Stage 1 - File Gathering**: Collect all instruction files from various Google Docs sources into a centralized Dropbox location. Ensure nothing is missed.

**Stage 2 - AI Analysis**: Use Claude to analyze the files for duplicates, similar content, outdated information, and quality assessment. The AI can process large volumes of text much faster than manual review.

**Stage 3 - Categorization**: Organize files into logical categories based on themes, workflows, and usage patterns. Create a clear folder hierarchy that makes sense for team members.

**Stage 4 - README Creation**: Develop comprehensive README files for each category that serve as guides to the guides. These should explain what's in each folder, how to use the instructions, and provide quick reference information.

**Stage 5 - Workflow Documentation**: Document how these instructions are used in practice - the order, the context, the purpose. This transforms a collection of files into an integrated knowledge base.

Discuss with your Team Lead the specific approach for using AI to identify duplicates and assess content quality. Plan how the README documentation will be structured and what information each should contain. Map out how workflow documentation will connect the individual instructions into coherent processes.

Throughout this session, document all planning decisions, the rationale behind the multi-stage approach, and the expected outcomes for each stage. This documentation will guide the execution of the project and serve as a reference for future similar initiatives.

The goal is to establish a clear roadmap that leverages AI capabilities to create a comprehensive, well-organized, and highly usable knowledge base for the Lead Generation Department.

Time allocation: 2:00 p.m. – 5:30 p.m.
