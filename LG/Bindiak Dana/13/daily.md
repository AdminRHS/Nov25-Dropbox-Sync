**What I worked on:**
- Met with the team to align on sorting all instruction files before the next automation pass
- Drafted prompts for Claude to remove duplicates, rename files consistently, and distribute them into the new folder hierarchy
- Logged the backlog items that must wait (account/messenger instructions, custom GPT export) so we do not overload today's scope
- Documented next steps for processing the custom GPT dump once it arrives

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Знаєш що? Що? Щоб відсортувати. Щоби вони були без дублікатів. Без дублікатів, відсортувати, перейменувати, розділити по папках. Це на сьогодні, не дай Бог, встигнеш. А-а, промпти для цього написать, перечитать файли. Там з акаунтами і месенджерами, те, що там тоже казали, треба робить це ну точно не сьогодні, а пізніше, бо... Звичайно. Блогерка: Нам би хоча б із цими всіма інструкціями розібратися. Заза: А, але в нас там ще плюс має бути якась вигрузка з Кастомного GPT, якщо я не помиляюся, тоже. Блогерка: Угу, да. Ну коротше, пока пишем промти, щоб він їх проаналізував, а далі побачим як піде. По ходу що будемо придумувати, то будемо і писати. Блогерка: Щоб він зробив? Бо так важко сказати. Дівчина: Да, о'кей.


**Outcomes:**
- Prioritized instruction clean-up tasks (deduplicate, rename, refile) for today's working block
- Prepared prompt drafts so Claude can analyze and categorize the documentation set
- Captured follow-up items (account/messenger docs and custom GPT export) for future sprints

### 1:15 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. - CRM Coaching Session with Ulviyya
**What I worked on:**
- Paired with the Team Lead to coach new LG manager Ulviyya on post-call CRM updates
- Walked through locating the lead/company profile, changing statuses, and assigning active agents
- Demonstrated how to clean LinkedIn conversations via GPT/Gemini and paste them into Communication + Notes
- Reviewed how to add communications properly, mark outcomes as “Happen,” and update event vs. call status

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

“The lead in the here I just want find with the CRM link you sent me but can't find the profile.”  
“Profile is the lead? The company.”  
“I find the lead but I can't find the company. Can you back please?”  
“Yes and left side from the contact. Contact you have profile?”  
“Yeah so scroll to the very up in and in the right corner you will see edit button. And here you have the to choose active agent it's the yeah and choose yourself yeah you have to choose your real name.”  
“Maybe your name is written in the system in Russian.”  
“I think yes I should change no no no and then you can see lead accounts and choose the account you were used to connected with that lead.”  
“I save changes and then open again and choose lead account okay and try to edit again.”  
“Okay so save again just in case.”  
“Okay now we have to fill out the communication here. Press add communication.”  
“Can you come back for a while I think he already did that.”  
“Uh huh. Let's wait for a second. You were Ulviya right?”  
“Yes.”  
“Okay can you add can you put an press on this communication? Action.”  
“Yeah in the right side you can see three dots yes add it.”  
“Okay.”  
“Oh so you did it but you just didn't put the notes. So you have to put the notes as well. For this you have to clean all your communication using AI tools. So go to LinkedIn page and copy all the communication with that lead.”  
“All of them?”  
“Yeah yeah yeah.”  
“Like this or message by message?”  
“Uh everything yeah you're right.”  
“Aha I copied and then—”  
“And then you can go to GPD chat or Gemini.”  
“Should I use pro version or is it okay?”  
“We'll try uh can you open the course that you have with that lesson there will be a prompt to clean the messaging. It's in the end I think if I'm not mistaken.”  
“Yeah you see prompt for clean and dialogue with lead.”  
“Down here?”  
“Yes.”  
“So put the prompt and put the dialogue.”  
“Yes yes is it try to refresh the page if i copy again now just check if everything is right.”  
“I saw copy days kind of communication do not use this button because that copy was comments from GPT chat so trying to copy it manually you know what I mean.”  
“I can't delete here.”  
“Okay yeah yeah you can I just want to be sure that you understand all right.”  
“Okay.”  
“And the same with the second one I am at again here the same communication it's the same dialogue.”  
“Oh okay and now we have to save it yeah and now we have good and tell me please had you already changed the status of the lead and of the company that event now my guess no.”  
“Okay so after call already happened we put the status call but usually you do you did it before call so you have to put the event but now that are that already happened so you have to put the status call.”  
“Yes update and also in communication field we have to mark happen again scroll to the right side.”  
“Oh it just alright you see stop relation or happen so you have to put happen but it's already done ok here what ok okay.”  
“And the only thing we have to do is to change the status of wall company but I can't find it let's move to profile oops I know how status here.”  
“Oh yeah let's do it with the edit button because I think you don't have the excess that's why you can see this card after searching ok company yes lead status yeah I see here we can put the call but before call we put status event okay okay okay and now save the updates.”  
“Call it should be saved as event or should I change it?”  
“But the call already happened right?”  
“Yes.”  
“Yes but indicate that I think there is like follow up status or a schedule because anyway if the call was scheduled but not happen we have to reschedule it I think we are good Xenia do we need to do something else? status event?”


**Outcomes:**

- Communication notes in CRM are cleaned via AI and properly logged
- Reinforced best practices for marking “Happen” outcomes and differentiating Event vs. Call status
