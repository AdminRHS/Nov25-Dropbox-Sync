## Task 1: Morning Account Check and Follow-ups

### Steps:
1. Open each working account inbox (LinkedIn, email, messengers) and pull the overnight queue of messages/network invites.
2. Process every new connection: send the approved first-message template and log the contact in CRM.
3. Review outstanding conversations and send required follow-ups (second templates), tagging outcomes and updating statuses in CRM.

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:

Keep Whisper Flow recording while you cycle through accounts. After each batch, refresh CRM dashboards to confirm statuses (e.g., “1st message sent”, “Follow-up sent”). Capture notable replies: log positive replies for scheduling, tag “Not interested” replies using the official template, and note any reschedule requests for the day’s call plan.

## Task 2: Call Creation and Coordination with French Lead

### Steps:
1. Update the lead/company in CRM: set status to “Call Scheduled”, add the cleaned conversation to Communication + Sales Follow-up.
2. Open `lg@rh-s.com` Google Calendar and create the event (Company – Remote Helpers), add Meet link, reminders, and required guests.
3. Send confirmation messages to both the lead and Sales team verifying the invite was received, and note responses.

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:

Follow the Meeting Setup Playbook for exact calendar copy. Record the Whisper Flow transcript while updating CRM and sending invites. After the lead acknowledges, drop a check-in to Sales (Slack) confirming the time, joining link, and any special notes from the customer.

## Task 3: Instruction Sorting and Prompt Planning Session

### Steps:
1. Meet with the team (Whisper Flow ON) to confirm today’s scope: dedupe, rename, and refolder instruction files.
2. Draft/iterate Claude prompts that will remove duplicates, standardize names, and categorize docs; document backlog items (accounts/messengers, custom GPT export) to handle later.
3. Outline the follow-up workflow for processing the upcoming custom GPT dump once current tasks finish.

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:

Keep detailed notes from the Ukrainian-language discussion in the Whisper Flow transcript and convert them into actionable backlog bullets. Update the instruction-organizing tracker with today’s priorities (dedupe/rename/refile) and list deferred items with owners so they can be scheduled once the GPT export arrives.

## Task 4: CRM Coaching Session with Ulviyya

### Steps:
1. Walk Ulviyya through finding lead/company records in CRM, assigning active agents, and updating lead accounts.
2. Demonstrate how to clean LinkedIn conversations with GPT/Gemini and paste the results into Communication + Notes.
3. Guide her through adding communications, marking outcomes as “Happen,” and switching statuses between Event and Call once meetings occur.

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:

Keep Whisper Flow recording during the coaching. Pause to let Ulviyya complete each action herself—only take over when access limitations block her (e.g., company card edit). Log any permissions issues to escalate, and summarize the session outcomes in the CRM or daily log so future coaching builds on today’s progress.
