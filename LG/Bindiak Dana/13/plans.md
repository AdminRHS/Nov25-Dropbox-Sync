## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Account Sweep and Communication Check**
   - Goal: Ensure every working account is reviewed for new networks/messages and respond where needed to keep customer touchpoints warm.
   - Expected outcome: Inbox zero across platforms and no pending customer interactions.
   - Deadline: Complete before transitioning to team project work.

2. **Workflow Optimization Document Processing**
   - Goal: Process the full batch of documents downloaded yesterday (validate completeness, relevance, updates, and categorization).
   - Expected outcome: Clean, up-to-date document set organized into clear subcategories for the optimization project.
   - Deadline: Finish during the main work block with the team.

### Medium Priority
1. **Custom GPT Document Processing**
   - Goal: Integrate custom GPT documents into the same optimization effort after the primary document processing is done.
   - Expected outcome: Custom GPT resources aligned with the refreshed workflow documentation.
   - Deadline: Begin once high-priority items are completed.

### Low Priority
1. **Identify Follow-up Enhancements**
   - Goal: Capture any additional improvements or data gaps discovered while processing documents and GPT files.
   - Expected outcome: Shortlist of enhancement tickets or follow-up tasks for future sprints.
   - Deadline: End of day recap.
