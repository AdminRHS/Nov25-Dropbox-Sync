## Task 1: Morning Account Check and Follow-ups

### Steps:
1. Open every working account (LinkedIn, email, messenger) and pull the overnight queue of network invites, replies, and unread chats.
2. Accept or reject new connections, send the approved first-message template to fresh accepts, and record each touch in CRM.
3. Cycle through existing conversations, send the required second follow-ups, and update CRM statuses (Connected/Interested/Not Interested) plus notes for every lead.

### Resources and Links:
- CRM Data Entry & Pipeline Guides
- LinkedIn message templates / first + second touch sequences

### Instructions:
Keep Whisper Flow recording while you process accounts. After each batch, refresh CRM dashboards to verify counts (Created, Sent Request, Responses). Capture notable replies for scheduling and tag “Not Interested” responses using the official template so Sales can filter them out later in the day.

## Task 2: Livestream Coverage Schedule Review

### Steps:
1. Walk through the livestream accountability interface to confirm camera-only mode, chat monitoring location, and how to start/stop the stream.
2. Review the draft shift schedule, note who owns each two-hour block, and document requested swaps or coverage gaps (especially evening slots).
3. Collect all open stakeholder questions (what clients expect to see, how chat should be handled, tech requirements) and route them to Katya for confirmation.

### Resources and Links:
- Stream dashboard / accountability tool access
- Team scheduling doc or shared spreadsheet

### Instructions:
Use Whisper Flow to capture the discussion in Ukrainian so the full context is preserved. Summarize any schedule changes and publish them in the team chat so everyone knows their time slot, backup person, and chat-monitoring expectations (silent stream, respond via chat only).

## Task 3: Instruction Audit and GPT Export Planning

### Steps:
1. Review the Restructure Report to identify yellow-flagged instruction files (CRM, LinkedIn, LeadGen, Onboarding) that still require manual cleanup.
2. Define the sequencing for GPT exports: list the custom GPT instances, note which dumps already exist, and decide where new exports will be stored.
3. Split the backlog across the team, documenting who owns each folder and which items are deferred (e.g., account/messenger docs, LinkedIn cleanup) until after today’s audit.

### Resources and Links:
- Restructure Report summary
- Shared tracker for instruction cleanup + GPT exports

### Instructions:
Keep Whisper Flow running during the planning session. Record decisions about pausing low-value tweaks so everyone focuses on the Restructure priorities. Update the tracker with owner names, deadlines, and storage paths for each upcoming GPT dump so future automation prompts have a single reference.

---

## Task 4: Instruction Repository Cleanup

### Steps:
1. Read through each priority folder (CRM, LinkedIn, LeadGen, Onboarding, InternalWorkflow), flag outdated or duplicate materials, and archive/remove them per the cleanup rules.
2. Refresh still-relevant guides with new audit details (terminology, status definitions, prompt references) and ensure cross-links point to current files.
3. Reorganize folder structure or README references where needed so related instruction sets stay grouped for the next automation pass.

### Resources and Links:
- Instruction folders highlighted in the Restructure Report
- Cleanup checklist / archival naming convention

### Instructions:
Work folder by folder, tracking changes in the cleanup log. When archiving or updating files, keep Whisper Flow logging to capture rationale for future audits. After reorganizing, double-check that CRM/LinkedIn/LeadGen/Onboarding READMEs reflect the new structure so automation prompts don’t reference removed files.
