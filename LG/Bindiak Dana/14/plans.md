# Daily Plan - November 14, 2025

## Instructions
**What**: Strategic plan for next steps
**Include**:
- Review your daily.md
- Prioritized action items
- Goals and objectives
- Expected outcomes

---

## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis and the latest workflow sync:**
- Instruction folders are split and partially audited, but yellow-flagged overview files still need expansion or pruning.
- Custom GPT exports remain outstanding; the team needs clarity on whether to pull data per manager or from the shared LitGen GPT.
- The Restructure Report is the source of truth for prioritizing which instruction sets (CRM, LinkedIn, LitGen, onboarding) to refresh first before moving to LinkedIn/messenger cleanup.

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Instruction Audit via Restructure Report**
   - Goal: Review every yellow-marked instruction/overview file (CRM, LinkedIn, LitGen, onboarding) and either enrich, rewrite, or remove sections with minimal content.
   - Expected outcome: Updated instruction set where all priority folders have complete, relevant guidance ready for the workflow package.
   - Deadline: Complete during the first work block today.

2. **Custom GPT Export Scope & Collection**
   - Goal: Confirm whether exports are required from each custom GPT instance or the shared LitGen GPT, then pull and store the data accordingly.
   - Expected outcome: Centralized export folder with clearly named GPT dumps available for prompt engineering.
   - Deadline: Immediately after the instruction audit finishes so prompts can reference the newest data.

### Medium Priority
1. **Workflow Day Outline Draft**
   - Goal: Translate the audited instructions into a “one working day” workflow summary that Claude can analyze.
   - Expected outcome: Draft workflow document that strings together the refined instructions in execution order for automation hand-off.
   - Deadline: Before end of main work session.

2. **Reading/Ownership Split Confirmation**
   - Goal: Lock in who owns each of the eight instruction folders so team members know which files to re-read and update.
   - Expected outcome: Assignment list showing responsibility for CRM, LinkedIn, LitGen, onboarding, and remaining folders, shared in chat.
   - Deadline: Right after the GPT export discussion to prevent duplicate work.

### Low Priority
1. **Prep for LinkedIn & Messenger Cleanup Sprint**
   - Goal: Capture follow-up tasks that depend on today’s workflow audit so next week’s LinkedIn/messenger pass has a ready backlog.
   - Expected outcome: Short backlog (notes/tickets) outlining what needs to be cleaned once instruction audit concludes.
   - Deadline: End of day recap.

---

## Goals and Objectives
- Deliver a clean, decision-ready instruction repository prioritized via the Restructure Report.
- Remove ambiguity around GPT export requirements so automation prompts use the right inputs.
- Produce a draft end-to-end workflow summary that bridges today’s audit with tomorrow’s automation tasks.
- Stage next week’s LinkedIn/messenger refinements without derailing today’s instruction focus.

## Expected Outcomes
- Yellow-highlighted instruction files updated, removed, or confirmed ready across CRM, LinkedIn, LitGen, and onboarding folders.
- Custom GPT data exports completed, stored, and labeled for use in Claude prompts.
- “One working day” workflow outline drafted and ready for team review.
- Follow-up backlog capturing LinkedIn/messenger cleanup tasks queued for next sprint.
