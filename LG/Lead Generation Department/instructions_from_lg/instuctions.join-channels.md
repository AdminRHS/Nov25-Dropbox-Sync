# Join all communication channels

Joining all communication channels is a fundamental step for new team members at Remote Helpers to ensure a smooth and effective start.

Discord as primary platform: channels such as \#lg-news, \#lg-hub, \#lg-sales, \#lg-main, and \#lg-beginner, as well as voice channels like 🔊 LG Beginners and 🔊 LG FM, serve as the central hub for communication and collaboration for the Lead Generation team.  
Stay in voice channel: stay in 🔊 LG Beginners voice channel in Discord throughout the entire workday and complete your tasks. You can leave the voice channel only during breaks or after the workday is over.  
Established communication rules: be available in voice chat, avoid spamming, share your screen on request, and enable notifications to stay on top of updates.  
Real-world examples: team members use Discord to share lead info, ask questions, provide updates, and coordinate tasks, demonstrating its practical importance.
