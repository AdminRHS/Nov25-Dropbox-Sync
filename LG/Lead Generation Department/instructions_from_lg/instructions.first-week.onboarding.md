### **1️⃣ Automated Performance Scoring System**

Each **onboarding category** has a **weight** in the final score (**100% total**)—this should be automatically calculated based on employee actions within the CRM.

**📊 Scoring Breakdown & CRM Automation**

| Category | Weight (%) | KPI to Track (CRM Integration) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| AI Fundamentals & Practical Use | 10% | AI queries used, outreach optimization completed |
| Google Sheets & Data Entry | 10% | Data entry accuracy, formatting verified |
| Search Quality & LinkedIn Usage | 15% | \# of effective search queries executed |
| CRM Performance | 15% | \# of leads added, CRM data accuracy |
| Lead Quality & Verification | 15% | \# of verified leads, correctness |
| Communication & Outreach | 15% | \# of LinkedIn messages sent, engagement rate |
| Business Knowledge | 10% | Quiz results, knowledge checks |
| Progress & KPIs | 10% | \# of leads contacted, conversion rates |

🔹 **CRM Automation:** Each **employee action is tracked automatically** in CRM fields (e.g., `Leads Added`, `Messages Sent`, `Calls Scheduled`).

🔹 **Final Score Formula:**  
**(Category Score × Weight) \= Employee Performance Score (100%)**  
E.g., (90% in AI × 10%) \+ (85% in CRM × 15%) \+ ... \= **Final Score**

🔹 **Automation:** CRM **triggers alerts & reports** when an employee’s score **drops below 70%**.
