# Creating a Google Calendar Event

Calls are scheduled in the calendar from Monday to Friday (we do not work on weekends and public holidays), between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Calls outside of working hours can be scheduled only after prior approval from the Sales department.

Before scheduling a call with an interested lead, make sure to collect the following details:

Email Address → So you can send the calendar invite after the event is created.  
Phone Number → As a backup contact method in case the lead is unavailable online.  
Date & Time for the Call → Confirm a time that works both for the lead and for your availability. Make sure to clarify the time zone.Note that our calendar uses Kyiv time (GMT+2). To calculate the time correctly, use a time converter: [https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)

❗️ Remember: AM refers to nighttime and morning hours (from midnight 12 AM to noon 12 PM). PM refers to afternoon and evening hours (from noon 12 PM to midnight 12 AM).

Note: This is our work email account used by the lead generation team. We use it for booking meetings with potential clients and handling other leadgen-related tasks. This account also has access to paid AI tools such as ChatGPT and others, so use them wisely to support your work. Please make sure to keep it professional and only use it for work-related purposes.

🗓️ Open Google Calendar

Open a new browser tab.  
In the top right corner of the screen (next to your profile picture), click the Google Apps icon — it looks like a grid of 9 dots (colored squares).  
From the dropdown menu, click on “Calendar”.  
🔍 How to Check Available Time Slots:

Open the Google Calendar  
Switch to Day view or Week view for better visibility.  
❗️Note: The left side shows the Lead Generation department’s calendar (blue), the right — Sales department’s (pink); they are synchronized, so any events scheduled in the Lead Gen calendar will automatically appear in the Sales calendar as well.  
Look through the calendar to find free time slots — these are time blocks with no existing events.  
Make sure the slot you choose does not overlap with any other scheduled call or event.  
❗️ Important: We never schedule more than one call at the same time. Always double-check the time before confirming with the lead.

➕ Create a New Event

In the top left corner of the calendar click “Create” → “Event” .  
In the pop-up window, click “More options” to access full editing view.  
📝 Fill in Event Details:

Title: Company Name – Remote Helpers (Example: Acme Inc – Remote Helpers)  
Date & Time: Set the agreed time with the lead. Set the duration to 30 minutes.  
Click → Add Google Meet video conferencing.  
Notifications: Add two reminders: 20 minutes before and 10 minutes before  
Add Guests: Add: sales@rh-s.com and the lead's email address

❗️Note: We use Google Calendar to schedule calls via Google Meet and WhatsApp. If a lead prefers to have a Zoom call, contact the Sales team, as all Zoom meetings are arranged by them. To schedule such a call, prepare a detailed event description and send it to the Sales managers.

🔎 How to Get the Company Info:

Go to ChatGPT, which is available on our LG account. Then open the LeadGen GPT section and use this prompt to create a short company summary:

Help me, please Make Client Research:

Find information about the company from the site  
Company site: \[paste here\]

Here is what we find from the site:  
\[paste full site info\]  
Here is information from About on LinkedIn:  
\[paste full LinkedIn About section\]

According to the info you find on the site and from About on LinkedIn, make a short description for the company. Keep it clear, concise, and use simple words.

Note: Once you're done, please rename the chat using your full name in English.

❗️Important: Only paste GPT’s final summary into the calendar — not the full prompt or raw research text.

🚀Finalize and Send the Calendar Invite

Double-check all event details.  
Click Save, then Send when asked “Would you like to send invitation emails to Google Calendar guests?” — and finally, invite your guests.  
Check if the scheduled event appears in the calendar.  
📩 Send a LinkedIn message to the lead informing them that the call has been scheduled and the invite has been sent to their email. Here is an example message:

Hi \[Lead's Name\] , I’ve scheduled the call for \[Date\] at \[Time\] \[Time zone\] and sent you an invitation to your email. Please check if you’ve received it.

Best regards, \[Your Name\]

📅 On the day of the call, send a LinkedIn message to the lead to remind them about the scheduled meeting. Here is an example message:

Hi \[Lead's Name\], I just wanted to remind you that we have a scheduled call today at \[Time\] \[Time zone\]. Our manager will be waiting for you. Have a nice day\! Best regards, \[Your Name\]
