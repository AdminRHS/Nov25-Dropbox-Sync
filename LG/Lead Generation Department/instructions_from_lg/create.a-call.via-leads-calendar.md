# Scheduling a Call via Lead’s Calendar

Sometimes, a lead agrees to a call and sends a link to their calendar where you need to book a meeting at a time that works for both of you.

To schedule a call using the lead’s calendar, follow the link they provided.

🗓️ Check Availability

You’ll see their calendar with available dates and time slots. At the same time, open our LG calendar and check when we’re available. Then find a matching date and time in the lead’s calendar that fits our availability.

🌍 Set Time Zone

After that, select our time zone (Kyiv time) at the bottom of the page. No need to convert the time manually — the system uses Kyiv time.

✔️ Confirm the Slot

Once you’ve selected the date and time, click Confirm.

📝 Fill in Event Details

In the “Name” field, enter the name of our company: Remote Helpers. Add the email address: sales@rh-s.com

Add guests by clicking the Add guests button and typing in the email address lg@rh-s.com as a guest.

In the comments section, add a short description of the event. Example: "We are going to introduce Remote Helpers and present our services."

Confirm and save the event.

📧 Confirm the Call is Scheduled

Check if the event appears in the calendar. If not, open the inbox of lg@rh-s.com, find the invitation email, confirm it, and check the calendar again.

⚠️After scheduling the call using the lead’s calendar, send a quick message to the sales department to let them know the call is scheduled. In your message include the date, time, lead’s name, company name and the event description.

✅ Change Company Status, Lead Status and add a Communication in the CRM.

📅 On the day of the call, send a LinkedIn message to the lead to remind them about the scheduled meeting.
