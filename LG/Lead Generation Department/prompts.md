### ✅ WHAT WORKS: Successful Patterns

#### 1. **Immediate Call Offer When Prospect Shows Interest**

**Pattern Observed:** When prospects respond with questions or show interest, immediately offer to set up a call.

**Example from Conversation 12 (Amram Pikarsky - CALL SET UP):**
- Prospect: "Hi, can you share a portfolio first?"
- Response: "Оur website rh-s.com has video CVs of our employee, their work experience and skills. We can set a call to see if we can find a fit for you and of course explain our model if you are interested"
- Result: Call was successfully scheduled

**Rule:** When prospect asks ANY question (portfolio, pricing, services), respond with information + immediate call offer: "We can set a call to see if we can find a fit for you and of course explain our model if you are interested"

---

#### 2. **Direct Call Scheduling When Prospect Initiates**

**Pattern Observed:** When prospect mentions "call" or "meeting" themselves, respond immediately with scheduling.

**Example from Conversation 12:**
- Prospect: "can you help me find the right match? we can jump on a call for that"
- Response: "Yes, it's better to set a call. When are you free?"
- Result: Call scheduled successfully

**Rule:** If prospect mentions call/meeting, immediately ask "When are you free?" or "What time works for you?"

---

#### 3. **Responding to "Tell me more" or "Interested"**

**Pattern Observed:** When prospects say "interested" or "tell me more", provide specific details + call offer.

**Example from Conversation 11 (Kevin Wuytack):**
- Prospect: "I´m always interested in collaborations. Tell me more."
- Response: "Thanks for your reply! Candidates we offer you to hire can work in the following positions: [list]... We can set a call to see if we can find a fit for you and of course explain our model if you are interested."

**Rule:** When prospect shows interest, list specific roles/services + offer call immediately.

---

#### 4. **Handling Pricing Questions**

**Pattern Observed:** When asked about pricing, provide direct link + offer to discuss on call.

**Example from Conversation 12:**
- Prospect: "I need to know more about your pricing"
- Response: "Here is our presentation with prices" [link]
- Then when they have more questions: "But first let's speak with our sales managers, they're going to tell you everything about our company and answer all your questions"

**Rule:** Share pricing link, then offer call for detailed discussion.

---

#### 5. **Responding to Portfolio Requests**

**Pattern Observed:** Direct to website + offer call to see candidates in action.

**Example from Conversation 12:**
- Prospect: "can you share a portfolio first?"
- Response: "Оur website rh-s.com has video CVs of our employee, their work experience and skills. We can set a call to see if we can find a fit for you"

**Rule:** Always combine portfolio/website reference with call offer.

---

#### 6. **Future Interest Handling**

**Pattern Observed:** When prospect says "not now" or "maybe in future", acknowledge + leave door open.

**Example from Conversation 5 (Pranav Kumar):**
- Prospect: "I would love to engage with you guys shortly. I am at the verge of finishing the legal procedures... I would love to get in touch in 3 months"
- Response: "Thank you for your interest in our services. You can find detailed information and current prices at this link: https://rh-s.com/pricing. We will contact you in 3 months, as agreed."

**Rule:** When prospect sets future timeline, acknowledge it, provide resources, commit to follow-up at their timeline.

---

### ❌ WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. **Vague Initial Messages**

**Example from Conversation 14 (Dayane Berton - REJECTED):**
- Initial: "I represent an outstaffing company from Ukraine. We have a huge number of remote employees for online work..."
- Prospect Response: "Sorry, would you please send me more information? What kind of work"
- Prospect Feedback: "Maybe your initial pitch could be better - difficult to understand what you are proposing."

**Rule:** Always be specific about what you offer. Avoid generic "remote employees" - specify roles/services.

---

#### 2. **Not Clarifying When Confusion Arises**

**Example from Conversation 14:**
- Prospect: "right now i am head of sales. Do you have this kind of role? Besides that, what is the payment for those 2-3 days working for you?"
- Response: "We offer you to hire our remote employees. As I understand you not interested in hiring."

**Rule:** When prospect is confused, clarify the model (outstaffing vs. hiring for us). Don't assume disinterest.

---

#### 3. **Overly Aggressive Follow-ups**

**Pattern Observed:** Multiple follow-ups without response can be seen as pushy.

**Rule:** Maximum 2-3 follow-ups. If no response after 3 attempts, move to "keep us in mind" message.

---
