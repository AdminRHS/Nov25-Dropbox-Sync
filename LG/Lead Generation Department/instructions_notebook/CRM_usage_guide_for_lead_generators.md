This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how lead generators should use the Remote Helpers CRM system. Adherence to these procedures is crucial for effective lead management and team collaboration.

I. Adding New Companies and Leads 

1. **Duplicate Check:** Before adding any company, meticulously search the CRM(press add new lead and use the following fields)  using the company name, website, and LinkedIn profile URL to prevent duplicates. This step is paramount\! Otherwise CRM won’t allow you to save a card if it’s a duplicate and you’ve just wasting the time for filling. 

# Adding New Companies

 If the company is not found:

* **Google Search:** Conduct a thorough Google search for the company.  
  * Add the company to the CRM.  
  * **Required Fields:** Company Name, LinkedIn Profile URL, Website URL, Company Size (employee count), Industry, SubIndustry (if there is any). Company size must reflect the total number of employees working at a particular company, not just one or two individuals.  
  * **Daily Quota:** Add a minimum of 50 new companies per day.  
  * **Geographic Focus:** Add companies exclusively from your assigned country (e.g., if assigned to Poland, do not add Austrian companies).  
  * **Diversity Considerations:** While diversity is valued, avoid adding contacts who are Hindu, Arab, or of color unless they are African American leaders located in your assigned country and hold relevant leadership positions. This exception applies only in specific, pre-approved cases.

**Finding Potential Leads:**

* After adding a company, use LinkedIn or Sales Navigator to identify potential leads within that company.  
  * **Lead Criteria:** Verify that each lead has 100+ LinkedIn connections and holds a relevant position within the company.

  # Adding New Leads 

  * **Maximum Leads per Company:** Add a maximum of 5 leads per company. Focus on quality over quantity.  
  * Use **Contacts’ tab** within the company card to add leads.  
  * **Data Completeness:** Add *all* available information for each lead: Lead Name, Lead Position, Contact Details (might be multiple “source” \+ “value”, ex. LinkedIn \- linkedin.com/test-lead-profile).  
  * **LinkedIn Links:** Only add direct page links from LinkedIn to the CRM. No screenshots or copied text.  
  * **Existing Companies:** When adding a lead to an existing company, meticulously verify the accuracy of Lead Position, Company Name, Industry, and Company Location.  
2. **Saving and Initial Status:** Save the lead card. The default status for a new lead is "Sent Request."

**II. Updating Lead Status and Information (Real-Time Updates)**

# **Statuses** 

Update the lead status in the CRM *immediately* after *every* interaction. Available statuses:

1. **Sent Request:** The default status assigned when a new lead is added.  
2. **Connected:** The lead has accepted your connection request.  
3. **Interested:** The lead has responded and expressed genuine interest in your services.  
4. **Not Interested:** The lead has explicitly stated they are not interested.  
5. **Ignoring:** The lead was initially responsive but has become unresponsive.  
6. **Follow Up:** The lead has requested to be contacted at a later date (specify the date).  
7. **Event:** A call or meeting has been scheduled with the lead.  
8. **Call:** A booked Call took place 

**Notes:** Add detailed notes in the CRM after *each* interaction. Summarize the conversation, record specific interests, and document any required follow-up actions. Be precise and thorough.

# Filters and Search

**Filters:** Use CRM filters to segment leads based on criteria like Lead Status, Country, or Industry. This allows for targeted outreach. All the necessary filters in the CRM left panel \=\> Leads page are grouped by purposes.

**Search:** Use the search function to find leads associated with a specific company name, contact person or his/her email address.

# Updates

Companies added to the CRM should be reviewed and updated at least every three months. This ensures data accuracy and allows for renewed outreach efforts.

1. **Filtering:** Use filters in the "Leads" tab to find companies that meet the criteria for review (Country, Lead Status excluding "Call" and "Not Relevant," and excluding "Client" status).

2. **Review and Update:**

   * Enter your details in the "Active Agents" field.  
   * Select your LinkedIn account in the "LinkedIn Accounts" field.  
   * Change the status back to "Sent Request."  
   * Thoroughly check and update *all* company information using LinkedIn. Add new leads and remove any who are no longer with the company.  
   * Add a note in the "Note" field: "Updated."  
   * Click "Update" to save the changes.

# Communications 

The "Communication" section serves as a comprehensive record of all client interactions.

1. **Date Entry:** Enter the date of the communication.

2. **Communication Type:** Select the appropriate type:   
- Basic Correspondence   
- Follow-up  
- First Connection  
- Presentation (sent via email)  
- Event (scheduled)

3. **Communication Channel:** Specify the platform used (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Email, etc.).

4. **Placement Value:** Enter the account name used for communication.

5. **Notes:** Copy and paste the *entire* conversation with the lead, exclude the dates and sender’s name (just pure dialogue text).

6. **Follow-Up:** set a reminder date not to miss the next possible conversation with that particular lead and copy relevant parts of the conversation.
