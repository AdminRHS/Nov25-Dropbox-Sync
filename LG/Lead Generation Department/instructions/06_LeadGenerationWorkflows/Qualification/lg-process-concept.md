**New Lead Generation Process Concept**

The new approach shifts focus from mass contact addition to deeply working on each lead who has shown interest. Template responses are abolished.

**New Lead Generation Workflow (Upon Receiving a Response):**

1. **Deep Research**:  
   * A mandatory company analysis. This is not just using AI functions, but developing the skill of understanding the business.  
   * **What to Analyze**: Website (About Us, Case Studies, Footer), Social Media (posts, videos, activity), reviews, mentions online.  
   * **Goal**: Understand the product, market, decision-makers, and identify "gaps" (weak design, lack of media content).  
   * **Tools**: Manual analysis, structured queries to Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity.  
2. **Lead Magnet Generation**:  
   * Based on identified needs, generate relevant value in a single shot (e.g., presentation in Gamma, AI video, image).  
3. **Response Generation via Custom GPT**:  
   * The collected context is loaded into the updated Custom Lead Generation GPT. GPT, knowing the company's updated capabilities (AI-focused services, relevant cases), generates a highly personalized message.  
4. **Sending and Monitoring**:  
   * Send personalized message and gift with subsequent effectiveness analysis for AI refinement.

**Key Principle for Implementation**:  
Start with manual execution of all stages for understanding the logic, and only then move to automation (e.g., Chrome Extension).

### **Implementation Plan for the New Process**

The plan is divided into stages with clear actions and responsibilities.

#### **Stage 0: Preparation and Administrative Discipline (Immediately)**

* **Suspend Responses**:  
  * Action: Notify the Lead Generation (LG) team of a temporary stop in responding to incoming messages until training is completed. Messages will accumulate.  
  * Responsible: Owners, LG Leaders.  
* **Setting Up Work Environment and Control**:  
  * Action: Ensure all LG staff have VS Code, Dropbox (with personal folders), and WhisperFlow (with a unified shortcut, e.g., Ctrl+Alt).  
  * Daily Check: Verify tool launches, creation of daily .md files in Dropbox, and WhisperFlow activation for recording all discussions. Continue checks until this becomes a habit.  
  * Responsible: Zhenya, Team Leaders.  
* **Forming the Implementation Group**:  
  * Action: Create a cross-functional team for implementation: LG Team Leaders \+ AI Department.  
  * Responsible: Team Leaders, AI Department.

#### **Stage 1: Updating Context and Tools (3-5 days)**

* **Updating Internal Context (What We Offer)**:  
  * Action: Update the list of professions and services to include AI capabilities. Outdated descriptions should be reworked.  
  * Action: Gather a base of relevant case studies by industry (e.g., Lufthansa case for aviation).  
  * Responsible: Owners, AI Department.  
* **Updating Custom LG GPT**:  
  * Action: Upload updated internal context to the GPT knowledge base.  
  * Action: Rework message templates by removing filler and adding focus on value and AI.  
  * Action: Integrate examples of successful manual responses to further train the model.  
  * Responsible: AI Department.  
* **Standardizing Deep Research (What We Search for)**:  
  * Action: Create a checklist for analyzing companies (product, market, decision-makers, website, social media, reviews, "gaps").  
  * Action: Finalize and document standard prompts for Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT (using Svetlana/Anna's work).  
  * Responsible: Implementation Group (LG Team Leaders \+ AI Department).

---

#### **Stage 2: Training and Documentation (5-7 days)**

* **Creating Training Materials**:  
  * Action: Develop step-by-step guides (Google Docs) and update/create online academy courses on three blocks:  
    * Deep Research as a skill (manual analysis logic, prompt usage).  
    * Lead Magnet Generation (working with Gamma, video/image generators).  
    * Using the updated Custom GPT (how to pass context correctly).  
  * Responsible: Implementation Group (Documentation – Alina, Anna).  
* **Conducting Training (Train the Trainers)**:  
  * Action: First, conduct an accelerated intensive training for team leaders and the AI department. They should master the manual process.  
  * Training for LG Department:  
    * Action: Conduct a series of practical workshops for all lead generators.  
  * **Testing and Certification**:  
    * Action: Conduct testing. Lead generators are allowed to respond only after skills have been confirmed.

#### **Stage 3: Restart and Optimization (Ongoing)**

* **Resuming Work**:  
  * Action: Begin processing accumulated and new messages strictly according to the new process (Deep Research \-\> Gift \-\> Response via GPT \-\> Send).  
* **Adjusting KPIs and Workload**:  
  * Action: Shift focus of metrics. Reduce requirements for the number of added contacts/cards. Focus on quality processing (e.g., 4-5 responses per day).  
  * Metric Goal: Reduce the negative response rate from 95-97% to 70-80%.  
  * Responsible: Owners.  
* **Quality Control and Feedback**:  
  * Action: Assign a "shift" person (from the AI Department or Team Leaders) for continuous monitoring of the LG-Messages channel.  
  * Action: The shift person analyzes responses and gives feedback to lead generators.  
  * Responsible: Team Leaders, AI Department.  
* **Continuous Improvement of GPT**:  
  * Action: Regularly make changes to the core of Custom GPT (not just in the chat, but in the model settings) based on real dialogue analysis.  
  * Responsible: AI Department.

#### **Stage 4: Automation (Future Development)**

Only after the manual process is refined, understood by all employees, and has become routine.

* **Developing Chrome Extension**:  
  * Action: Develop an extension for automating scraping information from open pages (website, social media, LinkedIn) and quickly passing structured context to AI.  
  * Responsible: AI/Automation Department.
