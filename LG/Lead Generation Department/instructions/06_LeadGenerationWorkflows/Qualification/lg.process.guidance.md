Adapt the formulas or add additional parameters with the help of GPT chat just by describing the parameter you need to count from the existing data. Debug the formulas till you receive the expected result.

# LinkedIn connection requests

Click the "Connect" button (usually near the profile photo).  
If the Connect button isn’t visible, check the "More" dropdown menu.  
Always add a personalized note (Recommended: Copy and paste a pre-written first message; you can use ChatGPT to craft a compelling outreach message within LinkedIn's word limit).  
Alternative Connection Points  
People You May Know → Be aware that sending connection requests from this section or search results may not allow for personalized invites.  
Events Pages → Engage with attendees and send connections after events.  
"People Also Viewed" Sidebar → Connect with professionals in similar industries.  
Group Member Lists → Sending requests to members of shared groups increases acceptance rates.  
Company Pages → Connect with employees from relevant companies.

2\. Profile Optimization for Higher Acceptance Rates  
Essential Elements for a Strong Profile  
Professional Profile Photo → A clear, high-quality headshot (avoid selfies).  
Compelling Headline → Showcase your value proposition (e.g., "Helping businesses scale with remote digital professionals | Remote Helpers").  
Complete Work History → Keep experience up to date.  
Skills and Endorsements → Add relevant skills and request endorsements from colleagues.  
Regular Activity & Engagement → Stay active by liking, commenting, and sharing industry-relevant posts.  
Building Credibility Before Connecting  
Share relevant content → Publish posts showcasing expertise.  
Engage in discussions → Comment on posts from target connections.  
Participate in LinkedIn groups → Adds credibility and increases visibility.  
Maintain an active presence → The more active you are, the more likely your connection request will be accepted.

Regular Maintenance  
To avoid LinkedIn restrictions or bans, regularly clean up old connection requests:  
Review Pending Requests Monthly  
Navigate to My Network → Manage → Sent  
Withdraw requests older than 30 days.  
Why Clean Up Old Requests?  
Prevents account flagging due to excessive pending requests.  
Ensures a better connection acceptance rate over time.  
Best Practices for Account Safety  
✅ Maintain professional communication → Avoid spammy messages.  
✅ Avoid sending too many requests at once → Stick to LinkedIn's daily limits (20-30 per day for basic accounts).  
✅ Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator properly → If using Sales Navigator, follow LinkedIn’s connection request guidelines.

Engage with their company updates to appear on their radar.  
Post-Connection Nurturing (After the Request is Accepted)  
Send a personalized thank-you message → Express appreciation and initiate a conversation.  
Share relevant content → Send useful insights, articles, or updates.  
Maintain engagement → Continue interacting with their posts.  
Look for collaboration opportunities → Add value before making an offer.

# CRM data filling 

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how lead generators should use the Remote Helpers CRM system. Adherence to these procedures is crucial for effective lead management and team collaboration.  
I. Adding New Companies and Leads   
Duplicate Check: Before adding any company, meticulously search the CRM(press add new lead and use the following fields)  using the company name, website, and LinkedIn profile URL to prevent duplicates. This step is paramount\! Otherwise CRM won’t allow you to save a card if it’s a duplicate and you’ve just wasting the time for filling.   
Adding New Companies

 If the company is not found:

Google Search: Conduct a thorough Google search for the company.  
Add the company to the CRM.  
Required Fields: Company Name, LinkedIn Profile URL, Website URL, Company Size (employee count), Industry, SubIndustry (if there is any). Company size must reflect the total number of employees working at a particular company, not just one or two individuals.  
Daily Quota: Add a minimum of 50 new companies per day.  
Geographic Focus: Add companies exclusively from your assigned country (e.g., if assigned to Poland, do not add Austrian companies).  
Diversity Considerations: While diversity is valued, avoid adding contacts who are Hindu, Arab, or of color unless they are African American leaders located in your assigned country and hold relevant leadership positions. This exception applies only in specific, pre-approved cases.

Finding Potential Leads:

After adding a company, use LinkedIn or Sales Navigator to identify potential leads within that company.  
Lead Criteria: Verify that each lead has 100+ LinkedIn connections and holds a relevant position within the company.

Adding New Leads

Maximum Leads per Company: Add a maximum of 5 leads per company. Focus on quality over quantity.  
Use Contacts’ tab within the company card to add leads.  
Data Completeness: Add all available information for each lead: Lead Name, Lead Position, Contact Details (might be multiple “source” \+ “value”, ex. LinkedIn \- linkedin.com/test-lead-profile).  
LinkedIn Links: Only add direct page links from LinkedIn to the CRM. No screenshots or copied text.  
Existing Companies: When adding a lead to an existing company, meticulously verify the accuracy of Lead Position, Company Name, Industry, and Company Location.  
Saving and Initial Status: Save the lead card. The default status for a new lead is "Sent Request."

II. Updating Lead Status and Information (Real-Time Updates)  
Statuses   
Update the lead status in the CRM immediately after every interaction. Available statuses:  
Sent Request: The default status assigned when a new lead is added.  
Connected: The lead has accepted your connection request.  
Interested: The lead has responded and expressed genuine interest in your services.  
Not Interested: The lead has explicitly stated they are not interested.  
Ignoring: The lead was initially responsive but has become unresponsive.  
Follow Up: The lead has requested to be contacted at a later date (specify the date).  
Event: A call or meeting has been scheduled with the lead.  
Call: A booked Call took place   
Notes: Add detailed notes in the CRM after each interaction. Summarize the conversation, record specific interests, and document any required follow-up actions. Be precise and thorough.

Filters and Search

Filters: Use CRM filters to segment leads based on criteria like Lead Status, Country, or Industry. This allows for targeted outreach. All the necessary filters in the CRM left panel \=\> Leads page are grouped by purposes.  
Search: Use the search function to find leads associated with a specific company name, contact person or his/her email address.

Updates  
Companies added to the CRM should be reviewed and updated at least every three months. This ensures data accuracy and allows for renewed outreach efforts.  
Filtering: Use filters in the "Leads" tab to find companies that meet the criteria for review (Country, Lead Status excluding "Call" and "Not Relevant," and excluding "Client" status).

Review and Update:

Enter your details in the "Active Agents" field.  
Select your LinkedIn account in the "LinkedIn Accounts" field.  
Change the status back to "Sent Request."  
Thoroughly check and update all company information using LinkedIn. Add new leads and remove any who are no longer with the company.  
Add a note in the "Note" field: "Updated."  
Click "Update" to save the changes.

Communications 

The "Communication" section serves as a comprehensive record of all client interactions.  
Date Entry: Enter the date of the communication.

Communication Type: Select the appropriate type:   
Basic Correspondence   
Follow-up  
First Connection  
Presentation (sent via email)  
Event (scheduled)

Communication Channel: Specify the platform used (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Email, etc.).

Placement Value: Enter the account name used for communication.

Notes: Copy and paste the entire conversation with the lead, exclude the dates and sender’s name (just pure dialogue text).

Follow-Up: set a reminder date not to miss the next possible conversation with that particular lead and copy relevant parts of the conversation.

# Make follow-up sequences

🔹 Introduction  
Follow-ups are a critical part of lead nurturing and sales conversions. Many potential clients don’t respond to the first outreach message, making structured, multi-touch follow-up sequences essential.  
However, email and LinkedIn follow-ups require different approaches:  
📩 Email follow-ups: More detailed, structured, and professional.  
💬 LinkedIn follow-ups: Shorter, conversational, and engagement-driven.  
This guide provides:  
✅ Key differences between LinkedIn & email follow-ups  
✅ How to structure a follow-up sequence  
✅ Email & LinkedIn follow-up templates  
✅ CRM tracking & automation best practices

1️⃣ Key Differences: LinkedIn vs. Email Follow-Ups  
Factor  
LinkedIn Follow-Ups  
Email Follow-Ups  
Length  
Short (under 100 words)  
Medium (100–250 words)  
Tone  
Conversational & casual  
Professional & detailed  
Objective  
Engagement, quick replies, staying top-of-mind  
Scheduling calls, providing detailed information  
Follow-Up Timing  
More frequent (every 2-4 days)  
Spaced out (every 4-7 days)  
Content Focus  
Quick check-ins, liking/sharing their content  
Value-driven content (case studies, proposals, reports)

2️⃣ Structuring Your Follow-Up Process  
🔹 1\. Define Follow-Up Goals  
🎯 What do you want to achieve with each follow-up?  
Booking a call  
Providing additional information  
Getting a response to a previous message  
Keeping the conversation warm  
💡 Example: If a lead doesn’t respond to the first two messages, the focus should shift from selling to engagement (e.g., sharing useful content, reacting to their posts).

🔹 2\. Recommended Follow-Up Sequence (Email vs. LinkedIn)  
Touchpoint  
Email Follow-Up  
LinkedIn Follow-Up  
First Follow-Up  
2-3 days after initial email  
1-2 days after connection request  
Second Follow-Up  
4-5 days later, with additional value (e.g., case study)  
Engage with a post, then send a soft follow-up  
Third Follow-Up  
1 week later, alternative CTA (e.g., free resource)  
Ask a direct question related to their work  
Fourth Follow-Up  
10-14 days later, check-in with urgency  
Send a voice note or informal message  
Final Follow-Up  
3-4 weeks later, last chance before marking inactive  
Last check-in before pausing contact

💡 Tip: LinkedIn allows for a more interactive approach, while email is better for structured follow-ups.

# Job requests \+ CRM 

🔹 Introduction  
Effectively collecting job requests from leads and properly logging them in CRM is crucial for maintaining accurate client records, streamlining the hiring process, and ensuring successful placements. This guide outlines best practices for engaging leads, gathering job details, and updating CRM fields for efficient job tracking.

1️⃣ Collecting Job Requests from Leads  
🔹 Step 1: Initiate Contact & Engage with Leads  
✅ Identify potential clients via LinkedIn, email, or direct outreach.  
✅ Establish initial communication to understand their hiring needs.  
✅ Aim to schedule calls or meetings to gain in-depth insights.  
📌 Best Practices for Initial Outreach:  
Keep your message concise and professional.  
Use a personalized approach based on their business needs.  
Offer a value proposition (e.g., "We specialize in finding top-tier talent in X industry").

🔹 Step 2: Determine Client Needs & Role Expectations  
Gather detailed job request information by asking targeted questions:  
❓ "What are the primary tasks for this role?"  
❓ "What qualifications or skills are required?"  
❓ "What are your hiring priorities and deadlines?"  
❓ "How do you measure success in this role?"  
📌 Key Considerations:  
Identify industry-specific skills needed.  
Understand the client's hiring urgency (immediate need vs. future planning).  
Capture budget expectations if provided.

2️⃣ Filling the "Needed Candidate" Tab in CRM  
🔹 Step 1: Access the "Needed Candidate" Tab  
Navigate to "Leads" in CRM.  
Select the specific lead for whom you are logging the job request.  
Open the "Needed Candidate" tab.

🔹 Step 2: Fill in Key CRM Fields  
Enter the following job details in the CRM:  
Field  
Description  
Department  
Select the relevant department (e.g., Marketing, IT, Sales).  
Profession  
Specify the job title (e.g., SEO Specialist, Lead Generator).  
Client Needed Tools  
List required skills (e.g., LinkedIn outreach, cold emailing).  
Client Needed Status  
Choose the correct job request status (see below).  
Demanded Date  
Set the current date (when the request was received).  
Note  
Add specific client requirements, preferences, and comments (any information that wasn’t a fit for other fields).

📌 Example Note Entry:  
"Client is looking for a Lead Generation Specialist with experience in LinkedIn outreach and email marketing. Urgent need within the next two weeks."

🔹 Step 3: Update Client Needed Status  
Status Option  
Meaning  
Required  
The client needs a candidate immediately and we already have a suitable candidate among available ones.  
Hunting  
We are actively searching for candidates for this role as we DON’T have any available for that job request.  
Demand  
The client was just inquiring and has no urgent need (If the client is not actively hiring but is interested in these positions).  
Closed  
The client no longer requires an employee for this role (and there was no deal from our side).  
Hired  
A candidate has been successfully placed in this role (by Remote Helpers, not a side company).  
Candidate  
A potential candidate has been identified for the role after a recruitment process.

📌 Best Practice:  
Regularly update the job status to reflect changes in the hiring process.  
If a client no longer needs a role, update the status to "Closed".  
When a candidate is placed, change status to "Hired" to track successful placements.

3️⃣ Advanced Techniques for Job Request Management  
🔹 Possible Automating Job Request Collection  
Use Web Forms – Integrate Google Forms or CRM forms to capture job requests efficiently.  
CRM Automations – Set up automatic status changes based on job request updates.
