Instruction for Sales Navigator

To start enjoying all the benefits of Sales Navigator \- you need to get it for yourself. We only offer a free trial that lasts two month. Make sure that your work account you want to connect Sales Navigator to has not previously had it connected. Otherwise, get another account by emailing the account manager.  
You also have to ask someone from your team who already has Sales Navigator to give you a referral  link cause without a link you’ll get only one free month of Sales Navigator.

Here is an example of the referral link.

Go to the link and click on “Redeem offer”

Also you have to ask your Team Lead to give you company card data to put it on the payment page.  
First name, last name and country are already filled in automatically from the data of your page, you do not need to change anything here. The rest of the fields are filled with the data of the card that Team Lead gave you. In the field "Postal code" enter the postal code of any Ukrainian city by googling it. Finish the filling process by pressing the "Review order" button.

In Review you will see when your free trial period starts and ends. After the end of this period, your subscription will automatically continue unless you cancel it first. Your card will not be charged because it is empty, but the subscription must be canceled at the end of the month anyway. You will be notified one week before the end date (on the e-mail address under your account), but you can put an additional notification on your phone or in the calendar the day before the end. After reading this text, click on "Start your free trial".

Congratulations, you now have the opportunity to work with Sales Navigator\!   
Going forward, to navigate to it from your LinkedIn page, you'll just need to click the rightmost "Sales Nav" button on the bar at the top:

But first, I recommend going into your account settings and selecting the audience you're most interested in. To do this, click on your icon and go to Settings. Go down a little lower to Sales preferences and customize all the settings you need.

cAfter that, go back to the main page in Sales Navigator. Here you can choose two search methods: search by leads and search by accounts (companies). To do this, select one of the options in the search bar at the top:  
![][image7]

Let's start with the account search. Basically, we will use three filters to search: Company headcount (specify the size of the company), Headquarters location (select the country we are working in) and Industry. In Job opportunities you can select a filter to find companies that hire through LinkedIn. There is a Pin filter button just above \- it will help you pin the filters you use most often.

cUnder the filters there is a button "Save search", which allows you to save the parameters you have chosen for the search, so that you don't have to customize them again. Each saved search has to be named something, you can use country, size and industry (e.g. United Kingdom 11-50 Soft. Develop.), or you can name it something else at your discretion. All your saved searches can be found later on the same page at the top by clicking on "Saved searches". Once you have customized your filters, you will see the search results on the right side of the page. You can save the companies you find to lists by using the "Save" button. Saved lists will be found under "Accounts" or "Leads" (in the bar at the top), depending on what you saved.

If you click on any of the companies, you can view a brief description of the company, make sure it is in the right country and industry, go to its website, or go to its LinkedIn page. You can also browse the company's employees, selecting all or just those in high positions (decision makers). Or you can go a little lower and see a so-called "account map" with employees.

Once you have selected the right person, you will see their page in Sales Navigator. But don't hurry to write to him, because your subscription is temporary and all correspondence will be lost after the trial period is canceled. To send a contact with the first message, go to the person's Linkedin page by clicking on the triplet and selecting "View LinkedIn Profile".

If you want to search by leads, select the appropriate tab with filters and customize the search parameters. You can use such filters as Company headcount (number of employees in the company where the lead works), Company headquarters (country where the company is headquartered), Seniority level (select all management positions such as Director, CXO, VP, Owner, Partner), Geography (country where the lead is located) and Industry (industry of the company where the lead works).

You can save the leads you find to lists too. Don't forget to go to the lead's LinkedIn page before you send a contact with a message.

**Only add page links directly from LinkedIn to the crm system.**
