   * **Website:** `https://rh-s.com`  
   * **Company Website:** `[Paste the clientвЂ™s website URL]`

### **Step 6: Special Cases & Additional Considerations**

#### **1\. Scheduling a Follow-Up Event**

* If this is a **follow-up meeting**, create the event using your **work Gmail** instead of lg@rh-s.com.  
* **Mark follow-up calls in orange**.  
* **Always add** `sales@rh-s.com` to follow-ups as well.

#### **2\. Scheduling via CRM**

* If the company **requires calls to be scheduled via CRM**, refer to the CRM guide.  
* Check for the **blog tutorial** explaining the process.

#### **3\. Phone Number Verification**

* If the lead provided a phone number, verify it before the call.  
* If missing, try:  
  * **Company Website**  
  * **LinkedIn Profile**  
  * **Using an AI tool to search for the contact information**

#### **4\. WhatsApp Calls**

* If the lead prefers **WhatsApp**, **do not include a Google Meet link**.  
* Instead, mention **вЂњWhatsApp CallвЂќ** in the event description.

#### **5\. Providing a New Invitation**

* If the lead **requests another invitation**, make sure to **resend the event link**.

#### **6\. Updating Lead Status in CRM**

* Once the call is scheduled, **update the lead status** in CRM to **вЂњEventвЂќ**.

#### **7\. Logging Communication After the Event**

* After the meeting, **document the communication in CRM**:  
  * **Date**  
  * **Type (Call, Zoom, WhatsApp, etc.)**  
  * **Channel**  
  * **Placement**  
  * **Meeting Notes** *(Ensure notes are proofread via GPT before saving in CRM.)*
