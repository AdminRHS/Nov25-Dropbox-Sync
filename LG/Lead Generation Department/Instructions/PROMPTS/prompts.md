→ Step 2: ...
→ Decision: ...
    → Yes → ...
    → No → ...
→ End

C) ASCII Visual Diagram

Example style:

[Start]
   |
   v
[Collect Data]
   |
   v
[Verify Info] --Invalid--> [Stop]

**3 I want you to analyze all files inside the following folder and all its subfolders (read full content of every file, not only filenames):

➡️ [INSERT FOLDER PATH HERE]

Your task is to identify all risks, weak points, and potential error areas within the processes described in these instructions.

🎯 Your Goals
1️⃣ Detect Risk Points

Read every document and determine:

where mistakes are most likely to happen

where steps are unclear, ambiguous, or not fully documented

areas with repeated human errors

unstable process parts (e.g., inconsistent, multi-step, manual, unclear responsibilities)

conflicting instructions from different files

outdated or contradictory recommendations

2️⃣ Detect Misalignment or Ambiguity

Identify cases where:

two or more documents describe the same step differently

terminology is inconsistent

steps are missing

prerequisites are not mentioned

instructions assume knowledge that a new employee may not have

3️⃣ Provide Detailed Output

Create a comprehensive structured analysis with the following sections:

A) High-Risk Areas

List every area with potential mistakes and explain:

what the risk is

why it appears

which steps cause it

which files contain conflicting or unclear instructions

B) Medium-Risk Areas

Steps or parts of the process that depend heavily on human interpretation or multiple tools.

C) Low-Risk Areas

Stable, well-documented, unlikely to cause errors — but still worth mentioning.

D) Recommendations to Improve Accuracy & Stability

Provide actionable suggestions:

what to rewrite

what to merge

what to clarify

what to reorder

what to convert into templates

what to automate (optional note)

E) Additional File or Documentation Needed

If any gaps exist, propose creation of a new file or instruction.
(Do not create these files — just list and describe them.)

📄 FINAL DELIVERABLE — Create a New File

RISK_AND_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md

This file must include:

High-risk areas

Medium-risk areas

Low-risk areas

Recommendations

Missing documentation list

Short list of files used as input (names only)

Only analyze and create the new file described above.



**4 Analyze all files inside this folder (including subfolders) and read the full content of every document:

➡️ [INSERT FOLDER PATH HERE]

Your task is to identify how the instructions describe:

efficiency

speed

quality of work
and connect these indicators to specific processes and steps.

🎯 Your Goals
1️⃣ Extract All Performance References

While reading each file, identify any part that describes or implies:

how fast something should be done

how efficiently a task should be performed

how accurate/precise/high-quality the output should be

expectations for daily/weekly results

performance standards

quality checks or verification steps

productivity expectations

These references may be explicit (clearly stated) or implicit (hidden within instructions).

2️⃣ Map KPI Indicators to Processes

For every process or workflow described in the documents, determine:

which KPI it influences

how performance is measured

where delays may occur

where quality might drop

which tasks directly impact final results

3️⃣ Produce a Structured Analysis

Your final file must include:

A) KPI Overview Table

A table mapping processes to KPIs. Example:

Process	Efficiency KPIs	Speed KPIs	Quality KPIs
Lead extraction	…	…	…
B) KPI-by-KPI Breakdown

Explain how the documents define:

Efficiency (e.g., optimized sequence, minimal manual work)

Speed (time expectations, daily quotas, required pace)

Quality (data accuracy, correct formatting, verified information)

Include quotes or references to specific files when possible.

C) Process-to-KPI Mapping

For each major workflow step, describe which KPI it affects and how.

Example format:

Process: Contact Sourcing
→ Affects: Efficiency, Quality
Reason: requires validation, deduplication, correct formatting.

D) Improvement Recommendations

Provide:

where KPIs are unclear

where actual performance indicators are missing

what should be added to make processes measurable

suggestions for new KPIs or clarifications

E) Missing KPI Documentation

List all cases where a process is described but performance standards are not included.
Recommendation: suggest what should be added.

Process / Workflow

Dependent on (other process/folder)

Criticality (High / Medium / Low)

Notes on potential risks or inefficiencies

Example:
