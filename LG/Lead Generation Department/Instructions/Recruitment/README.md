AND ("B2B" OR "SaaS" OR "remote")
AND ("LinkedIn" OR "prospecting" OR "outreach")
NOT ("intern" OR "student" OR "entry level")
```

**Advanced Modifiers:**

- Add seniority: `AND ("2+ years" OR "mid-level" OR "senior")`

### Interview Question Selection Guide

**For Recruiter Screens (20-25 min), pick 5-7 questions:**
- Q1 or Q3 (challenges/weaknesses)
- Q5 or Q6 (adaptability)
- Q8 (fast-paced environment)

## J) Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Common Recruitment Challenges

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Low response rates to outreach | Personalize messages more; test different value propositions; adjust boolean search |
| Candidates declining after screen | Review compensation competitiveness; clarify role expectations earlier |
| Scorecard delays from interviewers | Send reminder at 12h mark; escalate to hiring manager at 24h |
| Misaligned candidate expectations | Improve intake process; add screening question about comp/logistics |
| No-shows for interviews | Send 24h reminder; confirm via 2 channels (email + calendar) |
| Slow hiring decisions | Set decision deadline during intake; limit panel size |

### Escalation Protocols

**When to escalate to hiring manager:**
- Candidate requests compensation above approved band
- Red flags emerge (gaps in employment, reference concerns)
- Interview no-show with no communication
- Conflicting scorecard feedback from panel

**When to escalate to leadership:**
- Role open for 60+ days with no qualified candidates
- Market compensation significantly exceeds budget
