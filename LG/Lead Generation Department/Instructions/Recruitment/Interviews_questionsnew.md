### **🧭 Lead Generation Department — Remote Helpers**

The Lead Generation Department is responsible for finding and connecting with potential clients who might be interested in working with Remote Helpers.

Our main goal is to help businesses see how our services can bring value to them — whether they’re looking for designers, lead generators, or other specialists from our team.

On a daily basis, we:

* Search for potential leads (mainly via LinkedIn)

* Analyze companies and identify the right decision-makers

* Add them to our CRM system

* Create and send personalized messages using AI tools to make each communication relevant and engaging

Our focus is on **building real relationships** through meaningful communication — from the first contact up until the point when the lead is ready to connect with our sales team.

The team includes two Team Leads who are always available for support, guidance, and feedback. We also maintain separate communication channels for updates, notes, and everyday discussions to keep everything organized and transparent.

We’re open to ideas and feedback that can improve our workflow — collaboration and continuous improvement are at the core of what we do.
