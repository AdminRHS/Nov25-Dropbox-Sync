# Recruitment Playbook

Single reference for RH recruitment motions—sourcing, screening, and coordination—so hiring projects stay fast, consistent, and candidate-friendly.

---

## 1. Sourcing Framework

### 1.1 Intake & Role Alignment
- Confirm hiring manager, target start date, compensation band, and employment model (full-time, part-time, contract).
- Capture must-haves vs. nice-to-haves (skills, tools, industries, time zones).
- Define interview panel + decision maker.

### 1.2 Channel Strategy
| Channel | When to Use | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn Recruiter / Sales Navigator | Core channel for all pro roles; allows boolean targeting. | Save search alerts for long-running roles. |
| Job Boards (Wellfound, RemoteOK, Djinni, DOU) | High-volume IC roles or when budget allows inbound. | Mirror JD copy + include compensation. |
| Communities & Referrals | Niche skills (AI, creative, bilingual). | Use templated reach-outs; highlight value prop. |
| Talent Bench / ATS | Backfill and repeat roles. | Filter by `status = bench` or `past finalist`. |

### 1.3 Boolean & Outreach Cadence
```
("marketing manager" OR "growth lead" OR "demand gen")
AND ("SaaS" OR "B2B")
AND ("remote" OR "distributed")
NOT ("intern" OR "student")
```
- Aim for 30–40 targeted reach-outs/day.
- Use personalized openers (company/role mention) + clear CTA (“Interested in a 10-min intro?”).
- Log every outreach in CRM or the role tracker (date, channel, profile link).

---

## 2. Screening Process

### 2.1 Resume / Profile Screen
Checklist before inviting:
- Core skills present (match JD must-haves).
- Employment history shows stability (no unexplained gaps).
- English/communication signals (content, recommendations).
- Salary expectation aligns with band.

### 2.2 Interview Structure
| Stage | Owner | Goal | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recruiter Screen (20–25 min) | Talent partner | Validate motivation, salary, logistics. | Recruiter scorecard (fit, comms, comp). |
| Technical / Hiring Manager (30–45 min) | HM or senior IC | Deep-dive into skills, case, tooling. | Technical scorecard + follow-up questions. |
| Founder / Culture Add (optional) | Leadership | Values alignment, client communication. | Culture fit notes. |

### 2.3 Scorecards
| Criteria | 1 (Low) | 3 (Meh) | 5 (Great) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill Match | Cannot describe core tasks | Partial experience; needs training | Direct hands-on, teaches others |
| Communication | Struggles to articulate work | Adequate but inconsistent | Clear, concise, proactive |
| Motivation | Vague reasons to join | Interested but passive | Specific reasons tied to RH mission |

Use Google Sheets or Notion template; every interviewer must submit within 24 hours.

## 3. Coordination & Candidate Experience

### 3.1 Scheduling
- Use the centralized `lg@rh-s.com` calendar or the hiring manager’s calendar per role instructions.
- Send invites immediately after both candidate and panel confirm.
- Include agenda, video link, and interviewer names.
- For multi-time-zone roles, send time options using World Time Buddy screenshot or text.

### 3.2 Comms Templates
| Scenario | Template Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Invite | Role context, interview purpose, expected duration, confirmation CTA. |
| Reminder (24h) | Friendly nudge + link + reschedule instructions. |
| Rejection | Thank them, offer feedback snippet (if allowed), keep door open. |
| Offer | Compensation outline, start date, paperwork checklist. |

Store approved scripts in the shared “Recruiting Comms” doc; personalize before sending.

### 3.3 Stakeholder Updates
- Maintain a role tracker (Notion/Sheet) with stages, dates, owners.
- Send weekly summary to hiring manager: pipeline stats, risks, blockers.
- Escalate red flags immediately (no-show, comp mismatch, negative references).
