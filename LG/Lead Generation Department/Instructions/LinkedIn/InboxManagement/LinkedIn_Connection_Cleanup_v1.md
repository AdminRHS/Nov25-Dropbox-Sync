**How to clean up old LinkedIn applications:**

Every day we send out about 100 new LinkedIn connections, a large half of them are not accepted and accumulate in sent LinkedIn connect requests. When a large number of these requests accumulate, the account can be banned. Therefore, we delete all old requests that have not been accepted for 1 month or more.

Go to your working account on Linkedin, go to the **My Network** tab at the top and to the right is the **Manage** tab, click on it to go to the tab of outgoing and incoming invitations on LinkedIn.

Go to the **Sent** tab and you will see a list of your sent invitations. Click the **Withdraw** button and delete the old connection.

If during this time the lead has not approved your connection, it will hang until you delete it. Clean all requests that were sent 1 month or more.

Such cleaning is carried out on all your working LinkedIn accounts as the requests accumulate.
