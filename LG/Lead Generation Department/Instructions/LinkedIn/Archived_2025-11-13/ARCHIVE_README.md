## Why Four Files Existed

### Historical Context:

1. **templates.old-version.md** (2022-2023)
   - Original template library
   - Created when team was smaller
   - Many contributors over time

2. **lg-templates.new.md** (2024)
   - Refresh of templates based on performance data
   - Shorter, more business-focused
   - Best performers identified

3. **messages.gpt-version.md** (2024)
   - Created when integrating ChatGPT
   - Two versions: general + business English
   - Focus on AI-generated variations

4. **guide.masseges.md** (2024)
   - Operational workflow guide
   - Included templates for reference
   - Mixed process and content

**Result:** Version sprawl without clear single source of truth

---

## If You Need Historical Files

These archived files remain available for:
- Historical reference
- Comparing template evolution
- Recovering specific wording if needed
- Audit purposes
- Understanding past campaign approaches

**However, always use the current master file** `LinkedIn_Message_Templates.md` for active campaigns.

## Files Can Be Permanently Deleted

**After 6 months (May 2026)**, if no one has needed these archived files, they can be safely deleted as:
- All valuable content has been preserved in consolidated file
- No unique templates were lost
- Better organized version is available
- Team has adapted to new structure

**Before deletion:** Confirm with team lead that no historical templates are needed.
