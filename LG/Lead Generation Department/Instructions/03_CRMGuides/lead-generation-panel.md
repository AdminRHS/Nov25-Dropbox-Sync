**Lead Generation Panel**  
Lead Generation Panel \- this panel is your main workspace for tracking, managing, and reporting on all your lead generation activities. It's designed to help you stay organized, efficient, and focused on what matters most — finding quality leads and moving them through the funnel toward a successful call. ☎️💼

The Lead Generation Panel is typically accessed by clicking on "Lead Generation" in the CRM menu. Underneath this, you find various sections related to managing leads.

📍 Leads

This is the main page where you can view a list of all leads and companies in the CRM. You can use the search bar to quickly find specific leads or companies by name or email address. This section is essential for managing and reviewing all lead data in one place.

📍 Leads Test

This section works similarly to the Leads tab but with enhanced functionality. Here, you can instantly view company details without opening each card. You can search for leads or companies using company name, lead’s name, email as in the Leads section. But also: by website, by LinkedIn link of a company or lead, or even by social media links. This makes Lead Test a powerful tool for quick review and verification before adding or updating leads.

📍 My Lead Accounts

This section shows which working accounts are assigned to you, along with access credentials.

📍 Lead Reports

(using “LG daily”) – This section allows you to see how many companies you have created today. Make sure the “Filter data” is set to “create” to track newly added companies specifically.
