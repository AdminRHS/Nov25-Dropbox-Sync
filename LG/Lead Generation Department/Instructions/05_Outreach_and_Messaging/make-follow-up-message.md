**💬 LinkedIn follow-ups: Shorter, conversational, and engagement-driven.**

**This guide provides:**  
**✅ Key differences between LinkedIn & email follow-ups**  
**✅ How to structure a follow-up sequence**  
**✅ Email & LinkedIn follow-up templates**  
**✅ CRM tracking & automation best practices**

| **Tone** | **Conversational & casual** | **Professional & detailed** |
| **Objective** | **Engagement, quick replies, staying top-of-mind** | **Scheduling calls, providing detailed information** |
| **Follow-Up Timing** | **More frequent (every 2-4 days)** | **Spaced out (every 4-7 days)** |

# **2️⃣ Structuring Your Follow-Up Process**

### **🔹 1\. Define Follow-Up Goals**

**🎯 What do you want to achieve with each follow-up?**

* **Booking a call**  
* **Providing additional information**  
* **Getting a response to a previous message**  
* **Keeping the conversation warm**

**💡 *Example:* If a lead doesn’t respond to the first two messages, the focus should shift from selling to engagement (e.g., sharing useful content, reacting to their posts).**

### **🔹 2\. Recommended Follow-Up Sequence (Email vs. LinkedIn)**

| Touchpoint | Email Follow-Up | LinkedIn Follow-Up |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **First Follow-Up** | **2-3 days after initial email** | **1-2 days after connection request** |
| **Second Follow-Up** | **4-5 days later, with additional value (e.g., case study)** | **Engage with a post, then send a soft follow-up** |
| **Third Follow-Up** | **1 week later, alternative CTA (e.g., free resource)** | **Ask a direct question related to their work** |
| **Fourth Follow-Up** | **10-14 days later, check-in with urgency** | **Send a voice note or informal message** |
| **Final Follow-Up** | **3-4 weeks later, last chance before marking inactive** | **Last check-in before pausing contact** |

**💡 *Tip:* LinkedIn allows for a more interactive approach, while email is better for structured follow-ups.**
