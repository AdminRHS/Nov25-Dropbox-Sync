> **Personalization is non-negotiable**: Every message must show you've done your homework. Generic = Ignored.

### Core Principles:
1. **Research First, Write Second** - Never message without research
2. **Value Before Ask** - Offer insights before requesting time
3. **Brevity Wins** - Respect their time, keep it concise
4. **Authenticity Matters** - Sound human, not robotic
5. **Follow Up Strategically** - Persistence without being annoying

## Outreach Channels:

### Primary Channel: LinkedIn
**80% of our outreach**
- Connection Requests (with notes)
- Direct Messages (after connection accepted)
- InMail (for non-connections, limited use)

### Secondary Channel: Email
**15% of our outreach**
- Professional email to work addresses
- Follow-ups to LinkedIn conversations
- More detailed information sharing

### Tertiary Channels: Others
**5% of our outreach**
- SMS (special cases only)
- Twitter/X (for warm-up or engagement)
- Company Contact Forms (last resort)

## LinkedIn Outreach Strategy:

### Step 1: Connection Request
**Reference**: **send-connection-requests.md**

**Best Practices:**
- Always add a personalized note (300 char limit)
- Mention common ground or specific reason
- No sales pitch in connection request
- Professional profile photo required
- Send 20-50 per day maximum

**Connection Request Formula:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I came across your profile while researching [specific area/industry].
[Personalization: shared connection/interest/recent post].

Would love to connect!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 2: First Message (After Connection)
**Timing**: 24-48 hours after connection accepted
**Reference**: **lg-templates.new.md**

**Structure:**
1. Thank them for connecting
2. Brief personal touch (research-based)
3. Clear, concise value proposition
4. Soft call-to-action (question, not demand)
5. Signature

**Example Framework:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! I noticed [specific detail from their profile/company].

I work with [type of companies] helping them [specific value]. Given [company's situation/need],
I thought it might be valuable to have a quick conversation about [specific topic].

Would you be open to a brief call next week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 3: Follow-Up Messages
**Reference**: **make-follow-up-message.md**

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- **Day 3-4**: Gentle follow-up if no response
- **Day 7-10**: Value-add follow-up (share resource, insight)
- **Day 14-21**: Final touch point, offer to stay in touch

**Follow-Up Rules:**
✅ Add new value each time
✅ Reference previous message briefly
✅ Keep it shorter than first message
✅ Give easy out ("Happy to follow up later")

❌ Never be pushy or desperate
❌ Don't repeat same message
❌ Don't follow up more than 3 times

## Email Outreach Strategy:

**Reference**: **send-email.tab**

### When to Use Email:
- Lead doesn't accept LinkedIn connection
- Following up on LinkedIn conversation
- Sending detailed information or proposals
- Multi-stakeholder communication needed

### Email Structure:
**Subject Line** (Critical - 50% of success):
- Personalized, specific, curiosity-driven
- 6-10 words maximum
- No spam triggers ("Free", "Limited time")

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

[Opening: Personalization based on research]

[Problem: Brief mention of likely challenge]

[Solution: How you've helped similar companies]

[Call-to-Action: Specific, low-commitment ask]

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Company]
[Phone | Email | LinkedIn]
```

### Using Templates Effectively
