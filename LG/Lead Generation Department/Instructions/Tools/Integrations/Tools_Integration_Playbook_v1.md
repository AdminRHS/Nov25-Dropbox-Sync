# Integration Playbook

Reference for two critical integrations: LinkedIn Sales Navigator (outreach research) and the CRM time-tracking workflow (Clock-In).

---

## 1. Sales Navigator (Trial + Usage)

### Get the free trial
1. Confirm the LinkedIn account has **never** had Sales Navigator tied to it.
2. Ask a teammate with an active subscription for a referral link (2-month trial).
3. Open the link → `Redeem offer`.
4. Get the company card details from your Team Lead; fill the payment form (name auto-fills, add the provided card number, CVV, expiration, and any Ukrainian postal code).
5. Review the order → `Start your free trial`. Set a reminder one week before the end date to cancel (card won’t charge but we still cancel to avoid warnings).

### Configure preferences
1. In Sales Navigator, click your avatar → `Settings`.
2. Under **Sales preferences**:
   - Industries, locations, company headcount ranges you target.
   - Job changes/hiring signals you care about (pin filters for quick access).
3. Save each search with a descriptive name (e.g., `UK 11-50 SaaS`). Find them later under `Saved searches`.

### Workflow tips
1. Use **Account search** for company discovery (filters: headcount, HQ location, industry, job opportunities).
2. Use **Lead search** for decision makers (filters: seniority level, geography, industry, company size).
3. Save accounts/leads to lists to monitor updates.
4. When ready to message, open the LinkedIn profile (three-dot menu → `View LinkedIn Profile`)—avoid sending messages inside Sales Navigator so nothing is lost when the trial expires.
5. Cancel the subscription in Settings before the trial ends.

## 2. CRM Clock & Screenshot Discipline

### Clocking in/out
1. Log into the CRM dashboard.
2. Select **Remote Helpers** in the dropdown.
3. `Clock in` to start your shift; the timer runs until you either take a break or clock out.
4. For lunch breaks: click `Break` to pause → `Clock in` to resume.
5. End of day: click `Write report`, fill the daily summary, and `Send` (this action also clocks you out).

### Screenshot uploads
1. The CRM/Discord bot prompts you periodically—upload immediately.
2. Use only computer screenshots (mobile captures are rejected).
3. Ensure the screenshot shows date/time and the actual work in progress.
4. Click `Insert Screenshot` in the pop-up → select the file → `Send`.

### Best practices
- Clock in/out exactly when you start/stop working to keep payroll accurate.
- Keep a local folder with daily screenshots until the end of the pay period.
- Report technical issues with the timer or uploads to your manager right away.

Following this playbook keeps our Sales Navigator seats compliant and our CRM audit trail clean—both are required for smooth handoffs to Sales and Finance.
