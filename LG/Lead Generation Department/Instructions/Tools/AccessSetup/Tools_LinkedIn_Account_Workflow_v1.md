# LinkedIn Account Workflow

Everything needed to create, optimize, and keep a compliant LinkedIn profile for Remote Helpers outreach.

---

## 1. Create the account
1. Use the new work Gmail profile.
2. Navigate to [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com) → `Join now`.
3. Enter your legal first/last name (English characters) and the work Gmail.
4. Use the same strong password as the Gmail account to keep credentials in sync.
5. Verify via the Gmail inbox and complete any additional LinkedIn security prompts.
6. Avoid VPNs or rapid device switching during the first week—LinkedIn flags unusual IP jumps.

## 2. Complete the profile (Day 1–3)
| Section | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **Photo** | 400x400+ headshot, neutral background, professional attire. |
| **Background banner** | Use approved art from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Byb9ORkuehoJ-WGZgEdrFXdNaWqcGrxr) (1584×396). |
| **Headline** | Choose one: <br>`Hire online full-time remote employees | Marketing | Content Managers | SMM | Designers | Devs`<br>`Dedicated virtual assistants in Ukraine: Lead Generation | SMM | Media | Design | Developers`<br>`Build your online team in few clicks | Lead Generation | Marketing | Media | Design | Devs` |
| **About** | 2–3 paragraphs covering value, focus areas, CTA. Use ChatGPT for grammar-polished copy. |
| **Experience** | Add `Account Manager – Remote Helpers` (Full-time, started 2–3 months before actual start date). |
| **Education** | List all relevant studies with dates and honors. |
| **Skills** | Pin `Lead Generation`, `Account Management`, `Search Analytics`, `Research Skills`, plus 3–5 complementary skills. |
| **Languages** | List languages + proficiency (Native/Professional/Working). |

Finish remaining sections (recommendations, groups, customized URL) over the next few days to mimic organic behaviour. Limit new connections to 15–20/day during week one, 20–25/day afterwards.

## 3. Safety checklist
1. **No automation tools** (Phantombuster/Waalaxy/etc.) on this profile.
2. Keep logins to a single Chrome profile and stable IP.
3. If LinkedIn asks for ID verification, follow the flow immediately—delays increase ban risk.
4. Document bans/restrictions in the daily log and inform the Team Lead.

**Common triggers to avoid**
- Using temporary/brand-new Gmail accounts without warming.
- Copy-pasting entire profile sections instantly.
- Sending dozens of invitations or messages minutes after signup.

## 4. Ongoing maintenance
1. Share or comment on industry content weekly to keep the profile active.
2. Update the `Experience` description whenever our service offering changes (AI capabilities, new case studies).
3. Review privacy settings quarterly:
   - `Connections`: choose Public or Connections-only based on campaign sensitivity.
   - `Share profile updates`: ON when making role changes, OFF during testing.
   - `Active status`: ON so prospects see when you are online.
4. Quarterly self-audit:
   - View profile in an incognito window to ensure visibility.
   - Check for spelling errors.
   - Confirm that links (calendar, website) work.

## 5. Troubleshooting & recovery
1. If the account is restricted, open LinkedIn support → `Help → Contact us → Get help from us`.
2. Provide government-issued ID plus a short explanation of the legitimate business usage.
3. While waiting, pause outreach from other accounts to avoid cascading bans.

Following this workflow keeps our personal-brand profiles aligned with Remote Helpers’ messaging and reduces the chance of automation-related flags.
