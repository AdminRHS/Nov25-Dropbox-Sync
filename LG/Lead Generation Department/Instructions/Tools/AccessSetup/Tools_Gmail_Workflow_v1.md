# Gmail Work Account Playbook

Single reference for creating, securing, and configuring the Gmail identity used for LinkedIn outreach and tool access.

---

## 1. Create the workstation profile
1. Launch Chrome → click the profile avatar → `Add`.
2. Name the profile `LinkedIn_<FirstName>` and sign into Chrome with the new work Gmail once it is ready.  
   * Keeps cookies, extensions, history, and autofill data isolated from personal browsing.

---

## 2. Create the Gmail account
1. Visit [gmail.com](https://www.gmail.com) → `Create account` → `For myself`.
2. Use a professional naming pattern:
   * `firstname.lastname@gmail.com`
   * `firstinitial.lastname@gmail.com`
   * Avoid numbers/symbols unless the preferred handle is taken.
3. Password guidelines:
   * 12+ characters with upper/lower letters, numbers, symbols.
   * Unique to this account; store in an approved password manager.
4. Verification:
   * Use your real first/last name.
   * Add a recovery email (e.g., `niko@rh-s.com`) during setup.
   * Add a phone number only for verification; remove it afterwards in Google Account → Security → Recovery phone.

## 3. Security & privacy settings
1. Open [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Disable 2-Step Verification for now (our shared devices rotate often and SMS is unreliable). Re‑enable if team policy changes.
3. In Google Search settings:
   * Open any Google results page → avatar → `More settings`.
   * `Privacy & Safety`: turn **Search personalisation** OFF so results are not biased by previous research.
   * `Other settings`: set display language to **English** and `Result region` to the country you are sourcing for; confirm changes.

## 4. Professional profile & signature
1. Upload a neutral, well-lit headshot (same one you use on LinkedIn).
2. `Settings (gear)` → `See all settings` → `General` → `Signature`.
3. Create a signature using this template (update the placeholders):
   ```
   FirstName LastName | Account Manager
   Remote Helpers
   ✉️ your.name@remotehelpers.com | 🌐 rh-s.com
   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-handle
   ```
4. Set the signature for **New emails** and **Replies/forwards**.  
5. Scroll to the bottom → `Save changes`.

## 5. Workspace hygiene
- Use this Gmail only for lead generation work (LinkedIn, extensions, tool logins).
- Keep inbox labels simple: `Leads`, `Calendars`, `Internal`, `Receipts`.
- Archive clutter daily; never delete calendar invites until the meeting happens.
- Review security activity weekly; sign out any suspicious sessions.

Treat this mailbox as your digital business card—consistent formatting and tight security prevent mix-ups and keep our client communications compliant.
