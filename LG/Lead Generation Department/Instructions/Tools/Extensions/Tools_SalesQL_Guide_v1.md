## 5. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Extension not responding | Refresh LinkedIn, close/reopen Chrome, ensure you’re logged in. |
| No email/phone returned | Not all profiles have data—try another lead or different tool. |
| Credits exhausted | Wait for next month’s reset or request a paid top-up from your TL. |
| Manual install needed | Download ZIP, enable Developer Mode, `Load unpacked`. |

Keep SalesQL focused on high-value targets and immediately log the extracted contacts in the CRM to avoid duplicates.
