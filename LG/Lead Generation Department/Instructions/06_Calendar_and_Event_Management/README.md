```

## Step-by-Step Process:

### Step 1: Lead Confirms Interest
**When**: After positive response to outreach
**Action**: Move quickly while interest is high

**Immediate Response Required:**
```
"Great to hear! I'd love to connect you with our [Role] to discuss [specific topic].

Are you available for a 30-minute call next week?
I can do [propose 3 specific time slots].

What works best for you?"
```

### Step 2: Time Confirmation
**Reference**: **create.a-call.via-leads-calendar.md**

**Options for Scheduling:**

**Option A: Direct Time Proposal**
- Propose 3 specific time slots
- Include day, date, time, and timezone

- Let lead pick available time
- Receive automatic confirmation

**Option C: Lead's Calendar System**

- Follow **create.a-call.via-leads-calendar.md** for specifics
- Adapt to their preferred tool

### Step 3: Create Google Calendar Event
**Reference**: **create.google-calendar-event.md**, **Create_Event.md**

### Step 4: Update CRM Status
**Timing**: Immediately after creating calendar event
**Action**: Change lead status to "Event"

**CRM Updates Required:**
1. Status → "Event"
2. Add event date and time to lead card
3. Link calendar event in CRM
4. Add note: "Call scheduled for [Date/Time]"
5. Set follow-up reminder for after call

### Step 5: Confirm with Lead
**Timing**: Within 5 minutes of creating event
**Method**: LinkedIn message or email

**Confirmation Message Template:**
```
Perfect! I've scheduled our call for [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone].

You should receive a calendar invitation at [their email] shortly.
The meeting details and video link are included.

Looking forward to our conversation!

If you need to reschedule, just let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 6: Sales Team Handoff
**Timing**: Same day as event creation
**Action**: Ensure sales team has all information

**Sales Team Receives:**
- ✅ Calendar invitation (automatic via sales@rh-s.com)
- ✅ Detailed event description (in calendar)
- ✅ Updated CRM with research notes
- ✅ Any special notes or context

**Optional: Direct Notification**
If high-value lead, send quick message to sales team:
```
"Hi [Sales Rep],

Scheduled discovery call with [Lead Name], [Title] at [Company].

Date/Time: [Day, Date, Time]

Key points:
- [Important detail 1]
- [Important detail 2]

All details in calendar invite and CRM.

Let me know if you need anything else!
```

## Time Zone Management:

**Critical: Always Confirm Timezones**

**Best Practices:**
- Always include timezone in all communications
- Use tools like World Time Buddy to avoid errors
- When in doubt, confirm: "That's [Time] your time in [Timezone], correct?"
- Use timezone abbreviations: PST, EST, CET, etc.

**Common Timezone Mistakes:**
- Assuming everyone is in your timezone
- Forgetting daylight saving time changes
- Using ambiguous time formats

**Prevention:**
```
Wrong: "Let's meet Tuesday at 2 PM"
Right: "Let's meet Tuesday, March 15th at 2:00 PM EST (that's 11:00 AM PST)"
```

## Rescheduling Events:

**When Lead Requests Reschedule:**

**Immediate Response:**
```
"No problem at all! I understand things come up.

What times work better for you?
[Propose 3 new time slots]
```

**Process:**
1. Confirm new time with lead
2. Update existing calendar event (don't create new)
3. Send update notification to all attendees
4. Update CRM with reschedule note
5. Confirm new time with lead via message

**If Lead Cancels Without Rescheduling:**
```
"I understand. Would you like to reschedule for a future date,
or should I follow up with you in a few weeks?"
```

## No-Show Protocol:

**If Lead Doesn't Show Up:**

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes after start time):**
1. Send quick message: "Hi [Name], joining now. Let me know if you're running late!"
2. Wait 10 minutes
3. Send email if still no show

**Follow-Up Message (after 10 min):**
```
"Hi [Name],

I was looking forward to our call today at [Time], but it seems we may have had a scheduling conflict.

No worries - would you like to reschedule?
I have availability [propose times].

Let me know what works!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**CRM Update:**
- Add note: "No-show on [Date]"
