**Installing the Work Extensions**

**In our work, we use corporate extensions \- "Google Scrape" and "RE Extension".**

**🔹Google Search Extension (Google Scrape) is used to find companies based on specific filters such as country, city, industry, and company size. This tool scrapes the Google search results and automatically compares the results with our CRM database. The extension filters out any duplicates and shows you only the unique companies that are not yet in our CRM, making your lead sourcing process faster and more efficient.**

**🔹LinkedIn Extension (RE Extension) is used for collecting detailed lead information directly from LinkedIn profiles. It automatically pulls personal and company data (such as job title, website, email, phone, etc.) and allows you to create a new company card in the CRM or add the lead to an existing one.**

**📥 Download the Extensions**  
Go to your Discord channel \#lg-hub.  
Find the post containing information about each extension:  
Google Extension (Google Scrape)  
LinkedIn Extension (RE Extension)  
Click each download link and save the .zip archives locally.  
(Optional) Create a new folder for better organization and extract both archives there.  
Make sure to unzip the files before installation.  
**🔧 Install Extensions in Google Chrome**  
Open Google Chrome  
Click the three dots (︙) in the top-right corner and navigate to Extensions \> Manage Extensions.  
Enable Developer Mode if it’s not already enabled.  
Click on Load Unpacked and choose the folder where the extensions were extracted.  
Select the folder inside the extracted files for each extension (e.g., Google SCP and LinkedIn).  
To keep important extensions visible on your Chrome toolbar, you need to pin them:  
Click the puzzle icon in the top-right corner of Chrome (next to your profile photo).  
You’ll see a list of all installed extensions.  
Click the 📌 pin icon next to the extension you want to keep visible. The pin will turn blue, and the extension will appear in your toolbar.
