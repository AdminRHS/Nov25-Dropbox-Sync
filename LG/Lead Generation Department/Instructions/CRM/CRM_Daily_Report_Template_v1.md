**Daily Report**

**As mentioned earlier, at the end of each workday, you should send a daily report to the Discord channel and the CRM.**

In the first few days, your daily report should include a brief summary of the materials and lessons you’ve reviewed or studied. This helps your manager understand how you’re progressing through onboarding and training.

**📝Once you start adding companies, your daily report should include the following details:**

LG Manager: Your full name  
Date: The current date of the report  
Country: The country you’re currently working with  
Created: Number of company cards you created  
Sent Request: Number of connection requests you sent to leads  
Connected: Number of leads that accepted your connection requests  
Replies: Number of replies you received, both negative or positive
AI Tools: List of AI Tools you use for work
