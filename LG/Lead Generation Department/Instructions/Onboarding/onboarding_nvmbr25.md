## 4. Best Practices & Tips for Team Leads
1. **Data-First Feedback:** Start every coaching conversation with CRM metrics (creation counts, status aging, meeting ratio).
2. **Daily Audits in Week 1:** Inspect CRM cards + `daily.md` every day; taper only after consistent accuracy.
3. **Public Communication:** Direct LG questions and draft reviews to #lg-messages/#crm-mistakes for shared learning.
4. **OA-Y Integration:** Log course completion immediately; reassign if quiz <90%.
5. **Tool Resilience:** Maintain fallback SOP when Google Scrape/RE fails (manual search workflow in Research Playbook).
6. **Meeting Hygiene:** No invite should go out without Sales guest, agenda, time-zone confirmation, and CRM Event status.
7. **AI Oversight:** Review prompts/outputs weekly to ensure personalization and brand tone.
8. **Celebrate Wins:** Post at least one positive result in #positive-feedbacks by Day 5 to build momentum.
9. **Escalation Path:** Persistent non-compliance → Yellow card → action plan → Ops Lead escalation.
10. **Documentation Discipline:** Missing Whisper Flow links or daily files are immediate coaching moments—set the standard early.
