## L) Continuous Improvement

### Updating Onboarding Materials

**When to update:**
- New tools added to tech stack
- Process changes in CRM or workflows
- Video lesson links change or new lessons added
- Search strategies evolve
- Participant feedback identifies gaps
- Industry/geography targets shift

**Update Process:**
1. Identify gap or improvement opportunity
2. Test change with 1-2 participants
3. Document results and feedback
4. Propose update in Team Lead meeting
5. Get approval from Department Lead
6. Update relevant day file or general guide
7. Announce change in #lg-news
8. Archive previous version if major change

**Version Control:**
- Day files: Maintain current version only (update in place)
- GeneralGuides: Use `_v[Number].md` versioning
- Increment version for significant changes
- Note changes in parent folder update_log.md

### Feedback Integration

**Collect feedback via:**
- End-of-day retrospectives (Days 1-5)
- Post-onboarding survey (1 week after completion)
- Monthly 1-on-1s with new hires
- #lg-beginner channel discussions
- Performance metric analysis

**Act on feedback:**
- Timing adjustments (if consistent "too fast" or "too slow")
- Additional examples (if concept unclear)
- Tool troubleshooting guides (if repeated technical issues)
- Template improvements (if messages not converting)

## M) Language & Localization Notes

### Current Language Status

**Day-by-Day Files:** Written in **Ukrainian** (Days 1-5)
**GeneralGuides:** Written in **English**

**Rationale:**
- Ukrainian team members conduct live training sessions
- English documentation serves as reference for international context
- Hybrid approach supports multilingual team

**Translation Considerations:**
- Terms like "Lead," "CRM," "Extension" used in English even in Ukrainian docs
- Video lessons (oa-y.com) may be in English or Ukrainian
- Templates and search formulas primarily in English
