# Buddy Program Guide – Lead Generation Onboarding

> **Location:** Lead Generation Department → Instructions → Onboarding → Buddies
> **Audience:** Assigned Buddies (Isaac, Firuza, Dana, Anna, Ksenia) supporting new LG employees and Team Leads.

---

## 1. Program Overview
- Every new hire is paired with **one Buddy** for their first month; **Team Leads may be assigned two Buddies** due to higher workload.
- Buddies are the first line of support for minor questions, workflow clarifications, and daily task guidance.
- Complex or critical issues must be escalated to the Team Lead immediately.

### Objectives
1. Accelerate new hire ramp-up by providing real-time guidance.
2. Reduce Team Lead workload by handling routine questions and workflow walkthroughs.
3. Maintain CRM and process hygiene through proactive checks.

## 3. Role & Scope
- **Minor Support:** Answer day-to-day questions on workflows: sourcing, research, CRM entry, outreach sequences, reporting routine.
- **Process Guidance:** Walk through checklists, show where to find templates, review OA-Y lesson takeaways.
- **QA Assistance:** Spot-check new hire CRM cards for correct fields, statuses, and notes.
- **Escalation Gate:** Alert Team Lead when issues exceed Buddy scope.

## 4. Core Responsibilities
1. **Workflow Coaching**
   - Demonstrate step-by-step processes using existing SOPs.
   - Share screen or Loom when needed; ensure new hire can replicate independently.
2. **CRM & Lead Review**
   - Inspect at least 2–3 new cards daily for accuracy (dedupe, status, Needed Candidate, notes).
   - Flag mistakes directly to the new hire; log unresolved issues for Team Lead review.
3. **Issue Triage**
   - Answer quick questions via Discord/Slack threads for visibility.
   - Avoid making policy decisions—defer to Team Lead for exceptions.
4. **Escalate When Needed**
   - If the issue involves compliance risk, client impact, unclear policies, or repeated mistakes, escalate immediately (see Section 6).

## 5. Access & Tools Checklist
- CRM access with permission to view other users’ cards.
- Google Drive/Docs permissions to review research files and onboarding trackers.
- Discord channels: `#lg-beginner`, `#lg-messages`, `#crm-mistakes`, `#lg-hub`.
- OA-Y course library (read-only) for referencing lesson content.
- Whisper Flow transcripts when reviewing meetings or demos.

Buddies should confirm tool access before accepting an assignment; notify Ops/IT if permissions are missing.

---

## 6. Escalation Rules
### When to Escalate
- **Complex process gaps:** e.g., CRM rule changes, new automation behavior, unclear instructions in SOPs.
- **Compliance or client risk:** Wrong meeting invites, data privacy concerns, repeated duplicate entries.
- **Critical errors:** Multiple Yellow-card triggers (missing `daily.md`, absence of Whisper Flow links, noncompliant outreach).
- **Decision authority needed:** Anything that requires policy changes, bonus adjustments, or exception approvals.

### How to Escalate
1. Gather context: screenshots, CRM links, brief summary of attempts made.
2. Contact Team Lead via Discord DM + mention in `#crm-mistakes` or relevant channel.
3. Note escalation in onboarding tracker with date/time and resolution status.
4. Follow up with new hire after Team Lead response to ensure closure.

---

## 7. Best Practices for Buddies
- **Track Interactions:** Keep a simple log (date, topic, resolution) in the onboarding tracker or shared doc.
- **Encourage Self-Service:** Point new hires to the exact SOP file, timestamp, or OA-Y clip rather than re-explaining every time.
- **Stay Visible:** Answer in public channels when possible to share knowledge and reduce duplicate questions.
- **Proactive Check-Ins:** Schedule short syncs (10 min, twice weekly) during the first two weeks.
- **Respect Boundaries:** Do not override Team Lead decisions or promise policy exceptions.
- **Close the Loop:** Confirm that every question or issue raised receives an explicit resolution.
