# **Step-by-Step Guide for Job Sites**

### **1\. Start with the tables**

* Open the tables.  
* Take **100 links** that are assigned to you (check by color).

### **2\. Work with LinkedIn**

* Open the company LinkedIn link.  
* If in the table you see **N/A instead of a LinkedIn link**, try to **find the LinkedIn page yourself**.  
* **⚠️ Do not open more than 3 LinkedIn tabs at once\!\!\!** (to avoid account ban 🚫).  
* Add **leads (main positions)** through **re extension** as usual.


If the status in the table is **FALSE** – this is a new company and it needs to be **added**.

If the status in the table is **TRUE** – the company already exists →  skip it for now.

If the **status is incorrect** and the company already exists, simply **skip** it and **write** *“incorrect status”* in the Comment column. 

### **3\. Contacting leads**

* Send a **connection request** on LinkedIn.

### *After connection request is accepted*

* Continue with the **usual sequence of follow-ups** (second, third, etc.).

### **4\. Fill in the table**

* Update all columns ( Contacted at, LG Manager).   
* Note: Columns like Created at, Instagram link, YouTube link, Pinterest link, Facebook link, TikTok link, X link — no need to fill them in.  
* Use the **Comment** column for unusual cases. 

### 

### **5\. Special cases**

#### *Red industry or very large companies*

* *If the company has a **“red” industry**:*  
  * Manually add the company into the system or update it.  
  * If possible, add the **red industry**.  
  * If not possible, try to choose a **similar industry**.  
  * If there is **no similar industry** → **do not add the company**, in this case → Just send a **connection request**.

  When they accept your request → Send them the first LinkedIn message and follow-up messages.

#### *If LinkedIn has no useful leads*

* If there are **no relevant leads →**  skip this company, write about it in the **Comment column**, and **highlight the row in red**.

#### *If the company looks very large on LinkedIn*

* Double-check if it is really a big company.  
* If yes → Manually add the company into the system or update it.  
* When selecting company size in CRM, **choose the closest possible value allowed by CRM** (e.g., if the company has 20k employees but CRM allows only 10k, select 10k).  
* Send **connection requests**.

Mark the company in **red** and write a comment that it’s a big company and write about it in the Comment section.

**6\. Leads rules**

* First try to add: **Owner, Head of HR, Head of Marketing, C-level director**.  
* If only **Partner, Principal, or Board Member** are available → add them too.  
* If there is only **one relevant lead** and they have **less than 100 connections** → you can still add and send a connection request.

If there are **no available candidates** → highlight the row in **blue**.

**7\. Country check / Other countries**

* When adding leads with re extension, always select the **country shown on the company’s LinkedIn page** (the table may have mistakes).  
* Write a comment: “Another country.”  
* If it’s India, Pakistan, Japan, or other countries we don’t work on → **do not add**.  
* If you need to change the country → write in chat: **crm mistakes**.
