Dag Marina,  Het is alweer eventjes geleden dat we elkaar gesproken hebben, hopelijk alles goed daar?!  Een kort berichtje van mijn kant, sinds eerder dit jaar mijn eigen bedrijf gestart en we werken nu samen met een leuke partner: De WielerZesdaagse in Rotterdam Ahoy.   Een week lang spanning en sensatie (2t/m7 december), en een supertof evenement het jaar af te sluiten met jullie team, of om te netwerken.   www.wielerzesdaagserotterdam.nl  Als het je leuk lijkt om hier samen eens naar te kijken, hoor ik het graag, en natuurlijk een leuk moment om nog eens bij te praten!   Thanks,  Maikel

**Marina  Duka** (2025-10-02 07:43:46 UTC):
Hi Maikel,  Great to hear from you — it’s been a while! The project with De WielerZesdaagse sounds really exciting.  I was wondering if our services could be of value to you in this context. Remote Helpers specializes in AI-enhanced talent, offering quick access to AI Managers, Engineers, Content Creators, and Digital Marketers. Everything is fully remote, with flexible terms and no hidden fees.  Would it make sense to explore if this could support you and your team around the event?  Best regards, Marina

Hi Marina, I saw you liked Kenny Saad's post about cold emailing. Would you benefit from knowing where your emails are landing (inbox/spam) and being able to avoid spam issues before it's too late? It's free btw. Let's chat!

**Marina  Duka** (2025-03-25 08:18:09 UTC):
Hi, sure!

**Kateryna Petrochenko** (2025-03-25 10:31:33 UTC):
Great to connect, Marina!  My team recently launched a tool that helps you catch deliverability issues before they impact your outreach - it shows how many of your emails land in spam, pinpoints the issues, and suggests quick fixes.  + you can try it out for free.  If you're interested, we'd be happy to walk you through it in a quick 15-minute chat to see where your deliverability stands. Sound good?

**Kateryna Petrochenko** (2025-03-27 14:57:09 UTC):
Have you noticed how much harder it’s become to reach a lead’s inbox when sending cold emails, Marina?  Google & Outlook have rolled out new algorithms (again), making their filters even stricter.  We helped Slash improve their deliverability from 15% to 98% and increase open rates by an avg. of 25%.  Open to hearing more?

**Kateryna Petrochenko** (2025-04-01 13:41:38 UTC):
Hey Marina,  Imagine sending your emails without any problems and knowing they are all delivered!  Our new tool finds out if emails go to spam and gives tips to fix it.  Do you want to try it out for free?

Вітаю, Марина! Скільки продажів на місяць вам приносить LinkedIn?  Клієнти Remote Helpers точно є на LinkedIn. А значить, побудувавши систему генерації лідів в цій соціальній мережі ви отримаєте:  - Прогнозований потік клієнтів для вашого бізнесу, що легко масштабується; - Стабільні продажі за рахунок персоналізованих аутріч кампаній; - Збільшення ефекту соціальної довіри серед вашої цільової аудиторії.  Я менеджер ua.grinfi.io і ми будуємо для наших клієнтів системні продажі та сетапимо десятки зустрічей щомісяця через глибоко сегментований аутріч.  Як щодо невеличкої діагностики від нашого фаундера, де ми розберемо, які результати має давати LinkedIn саме для вас?  https://calendly.com/alexandr-mishyn-1/grinfi-io-intro

**Veronika Grek** (2024-11-15 09:35:06 UTC):
Марина, доброго дня! Хочу додати трохи конкретики, щодо результатів наших клієнтів на LinkedIn. Кілька відкритих кейсів https://ua.grinfi.io/cases з цифрами, що радують око 😊  Ми можемо забрати залучення MQL до вашої воронки продажів на себе під ключ, або розробити стратегію для вашого бізнесу та навчити вашу команду, як генерувати лідів та перетворювати їх на ваших клієнтів. Який формат буде актуальнішим для вас?

**Veronika Grek** (2024-11-22 09:41:03 UTC):
Марина, як ваші справи?  Доречі ми також маємо живий курс “Продажі на LinkedIn”, що допоможе знизити витрати на запуск лідогенерації, але є не менш ефективним, ніж персональний консалтинг https://ua.grinfi.io/course:  - 8 живих воркшопів, що допоможуть вам побудувати продажі в цій соц. мережі з нуля і до результату; -  2 Q&A сесії для розбору всіх ваших запитань; - Персональна робота з менторами в пакеті Premium.  А також практичні завдання, закритий чат з експертами та знижка на Grinfi Sales. Будемо раді бачити вас серед учасників нашого курсу.   Пропоную зробити коротеньку зустріч, де наш експерт відповість на всі ваші запитання та розкаже про цей курс ще більше. Що скажете?

Hello, Szilvia Barta! Would you consider hiring Ukrainian remote marketing employees on a full/part time basis for a reasonable price?

**Szilvia Miksiné Barta** (2022-04-18 11:34:03 UTC):
Dear Martina, many thanks but we have a very small team and no additional help is needed currently.

**Marina  Duka** (2022-04-18 11:35:20 UTC):
Thank you for the reply. May I send you our presentation and prices in case you will need our services in the future?

**Szilvia Miksiné Barta** (2022-04-18 11:37:25 UTC):
Many thanks, but I do not want you to waste your time with that.

**Marina  Duka** (2022-04-18 12:51:53 UTC):

Вітаю, Марина! Ви продаєте ваші сервіси на Лінкедін?  Ми створили Grinfi.io - першу на ринку аутріч платформу, що дає вам можливості: - Підключати безлімітну кількість Linkedin та Email сендерів у рамках однієї підписки. - Працювати на 100% безпечно за рахунок проксі та вбудованого но-детект браузера. - Збирати списки релевантних лідів прямо в середині платформи, знижуючи кости на додактові інструменти  Як щодо персонального демо де наші фаундери покажуть, як Grinfi.io може бути корисним саме для вашого бізнесу?   Букайте зручний час в календлі https://calendly.com/grinfi/demo або ж напишіть кілька ваших слотів та пошту, зробимо інвайт на своїй стороні.

**Max Kovalenko** (2025-01-17 13:20:30 UTC):
Привіт, Марина! розумію, що зараз важко знайти час для персональної зустрічі, тож СЕО продукту Олександр зробив для вас відео, де за 8 хвилин розібрав всі переваги Grinfi https://www.loom.com/share/a8279785ff2a44f8b7b6254b7735bc04?sid=d531c4b1-150e-49ff-b7d6-634de63d40e1  Безлімітна підписка, АБ тестування, безпека роботи - це далеко не всі переваги Grinfi.io. Тож чекаю вас на тріалі, де протягом 14 днів, ви зможете спробувати все самі без будь-яких забовʼязань. що скажете?

**Max Kovalenko** (2025-01-24 13:20:42 UTC):
Вітаю, Марина! Чи є у вас в команді спеціалісти, які генерують лідів на LinkedIn?  Крім продукту, ми також маємо команду та надаємо послуги з побудови та ведення процесів лідогенерації: консалтинг, написання меседжів, збір лідів, розсилки - закриваємо ці задачі, як в комплексі, так і певними частинами.  Як щодо особистої консультації від нашого фаундера, де ми проаналізуємо, які саме з цих задач ви можете віддати на аутсорс, а які простіше закривати самостійно?  Чекаємо на вас тут https://calendly.com/grinfi/intro

**Max Kovalenko** (2025-09-03 07:20:03 UTC):
Привіт, Марина! Пишу вам, щоб поділитися нашим чек-лістом “Як підготувати лінкедін профайл до результативної розсилки”.   - Перше враження та що на нього впливає - Візуальні та текстові матеріали - Що головне, а що є приємним бонусом при заповненні  https://grinfi.io/uk/blog/linkedin-profile-preparation-checklist/  LinkedIn дає найкращих лідів для В2В, якщо все правильно побудовано. Тож якщо у вас зʼявляться питання, ви знаєте де мене знайти 😉

**Max Kovalenko** (2025-09-04 08:05:04 UTC):
Вітаю, Марина. Детальніше подивилися чим займається ваша компанія і я розумію, що ви маєте генерувати лідів на Лінкедін. Grinfi допоможе вам ефективно автоматизувати цей процес. Дозволите відправити вам короткий відео лум з оглядом?

**Max Kovalenko** (2025-09-11 09:20:02 UTC):
Привіт, Марина! Ми в Grinfi.io автоматизуємо ваші Лінкедін розсилки безпечно та системно через:  - Запобігання банам від Лінкедіну з 5-кроковою системою захисту; - Автоматичну ротацію профілів та глибоку персоналізацію кожної розсилки; - Плагін для додавання лідів з Лінкедіну в 1 клік.  Запрошую вас на короткий міт, де покажу, як за 30 хвилин запустити вашу першу розсилку на Grinfi і вже цього місяця зробити ваш аутріч більш ефективним. Що скажете?   https://calendly.com/d/cmzg-3mr-8t6/grinfi-sales-demonstration

**Marina  Duka** (2025-09-11 13:29:51 UTC):
