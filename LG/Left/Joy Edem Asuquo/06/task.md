## Task 2: Sending outreach messages to all connected leads

### Steps:
1. Pull list of all connected leads from CRM
2. Review each lead's profile and background information
3. Prepare personalized outreach message templates
4. Customize each message based on lead's industry, role, and interests

### Resources and Links:

Schedule follow-ups based on typical response times for your industry.

## Task 3: Updating the CRM for all connected leads

### Steps:
1. Review current status of all connected leads in CRM
2. Update contact information if any changes are noted

4. Update lead status/stage in sales pipeline
5. Add relevant tags or categories based on recent interactions
6. Note next action items or follow-up dates
7. Flag high-priority leads or opportunities

### Resources and Links:
- CRM platform
- Interaction logs from communication channels
- Sales pipeline stages documentation
- Lead scoring criteria

### Instructions:

Systematically go through each connected lead's profile. Ensure all recent interactions are documented with dates and outcomes. Update the lead stage to reflect current position in sales funnel (cold, warm, hot, qualified, etc.). Add notes about interests, pain points, or objections mentioned. This creates a comprehensive view for future interactions and helps track conversion progress.

## Task 4: Sending follow-up messages

### Steps:
1. Identify leads who were contacted previously but haven't responded
2. Review previous message content and interaction history
3. Prepare follow-up message that adds new value or information
4. Time follow-ups appropriately (3-7 days after initial contact)
5. Send follow-up messages with different angle or additional value
6. Update CRM with follow-up activity and set next reminder
7. Monitor for responses and be ready to engage quickly

### Resources and Links:
- CRM lead interaction history
- Follow-up message templates
- Value-add content (case studies, whitepapers, articles)
- Response tracking spreadsheet

### Instructions:

Review which leads received initial outreach and their response status. For non-responders, craft a follow-up that doesn't simply repeat the first message - add new information, share a relevant resource, or ask a different question. Keep it brief and acknowledge they may be busy. For leads who showed interest but didn't commit, provide next steps or additional information they requested. Track all follow-ups meticulously to avoid over-contacting or missing opportunities.
