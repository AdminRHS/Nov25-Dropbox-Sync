## Task 1: Add leads to the CRM from job site spreadsheet

### Steps:
1. Open VS Code and access Dropbox workspace
2. Navigate to job site spreadsheet using Google Sheets
3. Review assigned companies and verify they are not duplicates in CRM
4. Use SalesQL to extract detailed lead information (name, title, email, company)
5. Open CRM platform and prepare for data entry
6. Transfer lead information systematically (name, contact details, job title, company, source)
7. Categorize leads by industry, priority, or status
8. Tag leads appropriately for tracking and follow-up
9. Verify all entries are accurate with no duplicates
10. Track daily count to ensure 15+ leads minimum (targeting 40/day by Monday)

### Resources and Links:
- Job site spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgUoDEX20sbiz678UKvi-gM14pl1bYY9M_69atzbOJc/edit?pli=1&gid=40443118#gid=40443118
- CRM platform (login: joyasuquo09@gmail.com)
- VS Code for workspace management
- Cursor for enhanced editing
- SalesQL for lead data extraction
- Google Scrape for additional data gathering
- Dropbox for file access

### Instructions:

Start your day by opening VS Code and accessing your Dropbox workspace. Navigate to the job site spreadsheet and review your assigned companies. Before adding any lead, verify in the CRM that it's not a duplicate - this saves time and maintains data quality. Use SalesQL to gather comprehensive lead information including verified email addresses and current job titles.

When entering data into the CRM, maintain a consistent format and ensure all required fields are completed. Categorize each lead appropriately so they can be easily filtered and targeted later. The goal is quality over pure quantity - accurate data leads to better conversions.

Track your progress throughout the day. You're currently exceeding 15+ leads daily, but aim to scale toward 40 leads per day by Monday. Work efficiently during your 9:30 AM - 2:00 PM and post-3:00 PM blocks to maximize productivity.

## Task 2: Sending outreach messages to all connected leads

### Steps:
1. Log into LinkedIn account
2. Check for newly accepted connection requests
3. Immediately open lead's profile and review background (within 30 minutes of acceptance)
4. Note key details: industry, role, company, recent activity or posts
5. Select appropriate outreach message template
6. Customize message with specific reference to their profile or company
7. Keep message concise (3-4 sentences) with clear value proposition
8. Send message via LinkedIn or email as appropriate
9. Immediately log the outreach in CRM with date, time, and message type
10. Set follow-up reminder for 3-5 business days in CRM

### Resources and Links:
- LinkedIn account (assigned account with higher connection limits)
- CRM platform for logging activity
- RE Extension for LinkedIn automation
- LinkedIn Extension (new version downloaded)
- Outreach message templates
- Company value proposition document

### Instructions:

Speed is critical for this task. Your data shows that faster outreach after connection acceptance leads to faster responses, whether positive or negative. Aim to message all new connections within 30 minutes of acceptance.

Before crafting your message, spend 1-2 minutes reviewing their LinkedIn profile. Look for specific details you can reference - a recent post, a shared connection, their company's recent news, or their role. This personalization significantly increases response rates.

Use your templates as a starting point, but always customize. A generic message is obvious and less effective. Keep your initial outreach brief and valuable - introduce yourself, provide a clear reason for connecting, and include a soft call-to-action that doesn't pressure them.

Immediately after sending, log the activity in your CRM. This creates a complete interaction history and ensures no lead falls through the cracks. The new LinkedIn extension you downloaded should streamline this process.

## Task 3: Updating and adding leads on the CRM

### Steps:
1. Open CRM and review all recently added leads
2. Verify contact information is complete and accurate
3. Add detailed notes about lead source and context
4. Update lead status/stage in sales pipeline (Cold, Warm, Hot, Qualified)
5. Log all interactions (messages sent, responses received, calls made)
6. Add relevant tags or categories based on industry, role, or priority
7. Note next action items with specific dates
8. Flag high-priority leads or immediate opportunities
9. Review response data and update lead quality scoring
10. Generate quick audit report to verify data accuracy

### Resources and Links:
- CRM platform
- Interaction logs from LinkedIn and email
- Sales pipeline stages documentation
- Lead scoring criteria
- Dropbox for synchronized data access
- VS Code for any data manipulation needs

### Instructions:

CRM accuracy is essential for reliable reporting and effective follow-up. At the end of each day, systematically review all leads you've added or interacted with. This is not just data entry - it's creating a strategic resource for future engagement.

For each lead, ensure all fields are completed. Add context notes that will help you (or team members) understand the lead's situation when following up weeks later. Update their pipeline stage to reflect current status - this helps identify where leads are getting stuck and where conversions are happening.

Document every interaction with dates and outcomes. If a lead responded positively, note what interested them. If they declined, note their reason - this data helps refine your approach. Tag leads by industry, company size, or other relevant criteria to enable targeted campaigns later.

Run a quick audit at day's end to catch any incomplete entries or duplicate records. Clean data today prevents headaches tomorrow and ensures your metrics accurately reflect your performance.

### Instructions:

Extension updates often include bug fixes, new features, and performance improvements that can enhance your workflow. Before updating, note your current settings so you can reconfigure if needed.

After installation, take 5-10 minutes to explore any new features. Often updates include functionality that can save you time or provide better data. Test the core features you use daily - connection requests, messaging, data extraction - to ensure everything works smoothly.

If the new version includes features that could improve your lead generation or outreach process, integrate them into your daily workflow. Document these for future reference and to share best practices with team members.
