1. File Organization

Review all files exported from Google Drive and the laptop.

Remove duplicate or irrelevant files.

Establish a unified naming system.

Organize everything into structured folders by type or topic.

Perform a final quality check to ensure order and consistency.

2. Prompt Development

Write prompts for file analysis and categorization.

Review all instruction documents to understand their context.

Test the first versions of the prompts on a small sample of files.

Record the best-performing prompts in a central Prompt Library.

Create documentation explaining how to use each prompt effectively.

3. Accounts and Messenger Files (Postponed Stage)

Identify and list all files related to accounts or messengers.

Move them into a separate “To Process Later” folder.

Schedule the detailed analysis after the first phase is complete.

Prepare preliminary ideas for GPT prompts (e.g., to extract logins, notes, or instructions).

4. Preparation for Custom GPT Integration

Collect a sample dataset for testing.

Create a base set of processing prompts and technical notes.

Define the expected GPT output (summaries, sorting, or categorization).

Check file compatibility and formats for automation.

5. Review and Reporting

Conduct an internal review of all current results (folders, naming, prompts).

Fix inconsistencies in structure or naming conventions.

Prepare a short summary report of completed work.

Define next steps and priorities for the upcoming stage.
