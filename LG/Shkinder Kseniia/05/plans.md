Go through lead cards carefully, checking for accuracy, progress, and proper updates to each manager’s activity.

Reassign accounts: remove inactive ones and provide new accounts to active managers who are currently handling leads.

Hold a meeting with the AI Department to discuss current updates, workflow adjustments, and better coordination between departments.

Provide assistance to managers throughout the day — respond to questions, solve technical issues, and monitor task progress to ensure stable performance.

Check the operation of key tools — SRM, CRM, Dropbox, and Wispr Flow — making sure all systems function properly and are synchronized.

Distribute additional LinkedIn accounts to compensate for the connection limits and keep outreach running without delays.

Track overall activity among managers, focusing on card quality, response speed, and consistency with daily performance goals (KPI).
