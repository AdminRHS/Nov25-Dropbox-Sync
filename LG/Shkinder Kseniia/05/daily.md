Dropbox Setup Session

Just listen. You have to look, because we will work with Dropbox one by one. I’ll help you manage this.
Do all of you have Dropbox installed on your laptops or computers?
— Yes, we have.
— Okay, Joel, let’s start with you. Can you please share your screen?

Girls, you will see Joel’s screen — try to repeat the steps after us, but if you’re not sure, don’t touch anything and wait for your turn.

Joel, can you open Dropbox? Do you see the Dropbox icon near your Wi-Fi icon?
— Yes.
Okay, click on it. What account are you using?
— My personal.
That’s the one we need to delete, because we couldn’t log out properly before. So now let’s uninstall it.

Open the search bar at the bottom of your screen, type “panel”, choose Programs, click on Dropbox, and uninstall it.
— Done.
Okay, that might take some time. While it’s processing, girls, tell me please, do you use Visual Code or Cursor?

Joel, once Dropbox is uninstalled, don’t worry — we’ll reinstall it later from the correct account.

Explaining the Process

You only need to delete Dropbox if you’re using your personal account.
For now, don’t use the LG account until we reinstall it properly.

Bridget, can you hear me?
(Bridget’s internet disconnects.)
Okay, anyone else can share their screen?
— I can go next.

Good. Press the Windows icon, open Control Panel, choose Programs, find Dropbox, and uninstall it.
Girls, you can follow along if you’re confident. Just uninstall Dropbox completely.

Now go to the LG account and search for Dropbox.
— Should we download it or just log in?
Download it first, then log in through Google – LG account.

Issue with Joel and Olivia

Olivia managed to reinstall Dropbox, but Joel accidentally downloaded it not from Chrome — maybe from a built-in app store. It automatically logged into her personal account again.
We think it happened because Chrome opened under her personal Google profile, not LG’s.

We’ll try again differently with Olivia to confirm the correct method.

Installing Dropbox Properly

Open File Explorer, scroll down, check if Dropbox is gone.
Good. Now open Google Chrome and type Dropbox Desktop (no “app” in the name).
Open the official site, click Install, Save, then open the installer.

Continue as Lead Channel, choose Google – LG account, and wait for synchronization.

After it finishes processing, you’ll have folders for every week in Dropbox and additional files in Visual Code, including:

Profile Regeneration

How to use all systems

Now open Visual Code → File → Open Folder → choose Dropbox folder → Select Folder.
If you see reports or other files, save them. You’ll soon get your full workspace synchronized.

Installing Claude and Git

In Visual Code, search for Claude.
Install it → Trust Publisher → Authorize through Google.
Then return to Visual Code.

If Claude doesn’t appear, try closing and reopening Visual Code.

Next, open Chrome, search for Git for Windows, download Git for Windows (x64), install it (click Next through all steps, skip optional ones).

Other Participants

Hanan: installation successful except Claude AI (blocked by VPN in her country).
Cynthia: everything done, but no files visible in Dropbox — probably access issue from the very start.
Elizabeth: installation and syncing done, working in Visual Code.
Others (Joy, Lera, Kibria): all working correctly.
