Task Breakdown - 07 Nov 2025
Instructions

What: Detailed action steps
Include: break each plan item into specific steps, links/resources, and clear execution notes.

Task 1: Reply triage & scheduling
Steps:

Pull all new replies (LinkedIn inbox + email notifications) and tag Hot/Warm/Cold in CRM.

Update each thread status and note last message date + next action.

Draft scheduling replies with 2 precise time options (Asia/Almaty) and a fallback “suggest a time.”

Log holds in calendar; add meeting objective + candidate pack (if requested).

Confirm with lead; set reminder to nudge if no response in 24h.

Resources and Links:

LinkedIn Messaging: https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/

Time zone helper: https://everytimezone.com/

Word counter (600–700 char check): https://wordcounter.net/

Instructions:

Use concise summaries of their pain point, then propose a short intro chat. Offer two slots (e.g., “Mon 10:00 or 16:30, Asia/Almaty”). Keep tone friendly, non-pushy. Immediately record outcome in CRM.

Task 2: FU2/FU3 dispatch to non-responders
Steps:

Filter non-responders by last touch: 5–7 days → FU2; 10–12 days → FU3.

Personalize first sentence with role/company cue; introduce a new benefit vs prior message.

Ensure CTA progression: FU2/FU3 must be call-booking (“15 minutes next week?”).

Validate each message: AI-first solution, 600–700 chars, no link, no stop-words.

Queue and send; set follow-up tasks in CRM.

Resources and Links:

Style/length check: https://www.charactercountonline.com/

Calendar link placeholder (for offers): add your internal booking URL

RH site (reference only, do not include in FU): https://rh-s.com/

Instructions:

FU2 focuses on deliverables (e.g., “video CVs inside”), FU3 emphasizes ease (“easy hiring,” “stop any time”). Keep CTAs direct to book a call. Avoid repeating phrases used in the first message.

Task 3: Video-CV shortlist for AI roles (Automation Manager & Prompt Engineer)
Steps:

Define 2–3 must-have criteria per role (tools, domain, timezone overlap).

Source 6–8 candidates per role from talent pool; narrow to 3–5 per role.

Collect video CV links + 3-line summaries (skills, use-cases, start date).

Package into a sharable doc (role sections, thumbnails, availability table).

Attach to warm threads; note who received which pack in CRM.

Resources and Links:

RH Talent profiles (internal): your CRM/Talent DB URL

Doc template (internal): your Google Docs/Drive template URL

File naming: ClientName_Role_VideoCVs_2025-11-07

Instructions:

Highlight AI-first capabilities tied to the lead’s pains (e.g., workflow automation, prompt libraries). Keep each candidate summary skimmable. Confirm availability windows and language level before sending.
