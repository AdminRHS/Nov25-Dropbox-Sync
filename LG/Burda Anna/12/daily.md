Show me please my network. Uh, why so many, uh, tab are open? one more only three linkedin yeah but it's big you work in all three tap um no I just once I finish this I close it and then go back mm-hmm Yeah but I asking you to show me your network not try to open the daniela bernick do you see november 11 message message tap on message and show me actually daniela i just reminded me i didn't update her in this arm because i couldn't find her name and i was planning to okay but show me the message which you sent scroll up yes it used the okay okay you can close okay uh uh the first kurt harald do can you see him okay all right okay david zhang also didn't send yes yes these three not yet okay yes i see your screen try today to send message without emoji to take off all emoji and send the message okay this lead like all the leads from now on yes from 12 november which you have a new connection lead try to send in this way okay it's for experience to see how it works yes i think it's a good idea because i remember a a german client a german lead he sent me a message like saying sarcastically saying i used too many emojis yeah so try okay today work with alt connection alt connection you mean send the second message no the kenya right in lg main do you see about the old connection and template for old connection yes this is the term what i did is uh this is the template i copied the message and i sent it as a second whole message right oh how the houses document our name updated re-engagement templates long term focus how where you see that follow up oh i think yeah
LG main in Discord, yeah group. Can you share take more bigger that I can see? Do you see this message? Yeah I actually read them all. No or this or this. All these connections. Yeah that's exactly what I did. I opened the oldest connections meaning that the old leads which I sent them a first message but they didn't respond. So I used this template to send them a second message. Did I do it right? No. You should find the first connection lead which was first connected and try to send the message that you sent this message to the lead who connected 6 months ago. So it will be like a third message. Like for example, you mean I go maybe very old like last month. Here not last month is last month. It's not the 6 months ago. Yes 6 months ago. I couldn't stay here. You say that you work with this in which way? You send the message for old connections leads who didn't answer you 3 weeks ago. No I actually sent it to leads who didn't like every 2 days we need to send a follow-up message. I sent them that template but it's a mistake. Yes because I remember once I think you've written it or you told us that we do not send more than 3 messages to all leads. It's always the first and second message. That's why for example I didn't send a third message. The lead had conversation with you 6 months ago or more months ago. So now it's accounted as the first message that you come back this conversation and maybe the lead has some changes in the company and they maybe now she is interested in our services. Okay I understand now. Yeah 6 months ago will be July or 2. Yeah it can be more earlier. So you can scroll down to the first lead connected and starting with this. Okay yes now I understand but do you send this template some lead like for example yesterday I needed to send a follow-up message to this lead after 2 days or 3. I needed to send a follow-up message to this lead so I used that new template to send him the message. Yeah but why you didn't ask Xenia about this for old connections. Why you didn't ask Xenia how to work it. Yes I thought I understood it because I read the message and I thought I understood it because all these connections. I thought it was clear. I didn't know it was for more than 6 months because it wasn't mentioned here. Yeah but it is not new a new template. You say that it's an ID. I take the new template to send the follow-up message but I didn't see anywhere where they're mentioned about follow-up my new template follow-up in this document. Yeah you're right maybe I just misunderstood this re-engagement with. Yeah but you can to ask.
