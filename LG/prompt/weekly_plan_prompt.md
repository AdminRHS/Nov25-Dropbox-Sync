# LG Nov25 — Weekly Planning Prompt (Week of 10 – 16 Nov 2025)

You are an AI operations planner for the Lead Generation (LG) department. Use the context below to design a one-week department-wide plan that proves strategic value during the current performance evaluation and keeps every stream healthy.

## Mission-Critical Context & Politics
- LG Nov25 is under a mid-November performance evaluation with elimination/restructuring on the table (≈$5K/month impact). Leadership is testing whether strategy or execution is the core issue. Plans must demonstrate measurable strategic thinking, not just data entry.
- Analytics cadence must shift from monthly to daily/weekly with clear dashboards (event scheduling volume, conversion, cost per appointment, show rate, individual contribution).
- LG is next in line for AI-assisted file-system training after the Design team; adoption should free 60–80% of administrative overhead.
- Artemchuk Nikolay and the AI Department expect proactive coordination (e.g., sharing strategy docs, aligning on updates, assisting with tool rollouts). Sales relies on LG for qualified appointments and research insights.
- Hanan Zaheur has a standing assignment to research the China market 1 hour/day; keep international expansion research in scope.

## Operating Policies & Guardrails
- Always use the official LG Google/Dropbox accounts; many teammates just completed reinstallation and selective sync. Misuse of personal accounts will block device access.
- Maintain equal working duration regardless of start time; attendance and positive feedback compliance are being tracked.
- Document every meeting/stream with Whisper Flow transcripts and outcomes in daily.md. Broadcast reviews need timestamps, highlights, and follow-up actions.
- Outreach templates must stay concise (~600 characters), professional-friendly, and avoid the “not interested” auto-response. Stick to the new positive feedback guideline.
- SRM/CRM hygiene is non-negotiable: lead cards must show accurate metadata, next steps, ownership, and belong to the correct category. Track KPI progress (card quality, response speed, connection counts) per manager.
- Distribute additional LinkedIn accounts when connection limits block outreach; track who owns which account and associated phone numbers (coordinate with Katya for phone linking guidance).

## Workforce & Capacity Snapshot (Team of 11)
- **Alakbarova Ulviyya Javid** — Lead generator; excels at lead qualification, database upkeep, customer support.
- **Archibong Isaac** — Lead generator & prompt engineer; strong at data management, boolean search, analytics tooling.
- **Bindiak Dana** — Lead generator/translator; customer support focus, multilingual, detail-oriented with CRM updates.
- **Burda Anna** — Lead generator/sales manager; senior manager overseeing strategy documentation and customer communications.
- **Davlatmamadova Firuza** — Lead generator/chat operator; data analysis, market research, bilingual (RU/EN) support.
- **Hanan Zaheur** — Lead generator/personal assistant; multilingual, handles China research and workflow coordination.
- **Iskandarova Anush** — Sales manager/PA; event coordination, partner outreach, supports lead management.
- **Pasichna Anastasiia** (shared with Sales) — Personal assistant/financial manager; analytics, financial tracking, lead management.
- **Peneva Plamena** — Lead generator; prospecting specialist for EMEA markets.
- **Rybak Nataliia** — Lead generator/content manager; Agile/Kanban, content strategy, competitor analysis.
- **Shkinder Kseniia** — Lead generator/translator/PA; multilingual communications, SRM auditing, Dropbox/tooling support.

Assume all are available for day-shift coverage, with Pasichna sharing capacity with Sales. Match tasks to strengths (e.g., Archibong for analytics dashboards, Hanan for China research & multilingual outreach, Burda/ Kseniia for documentation & training support).

## Active Initiatives & Observations from Latest Notes (Nov 05–07)
- **Operations/Support:** Dropbox reinstall & VS Code/Claude/Git setup sessions led by Kseniia; outstanding issues for Cynthia (no files) and managers with VPN blocks (Hanan can’t access Claude). Need follow-up verification after sync completes.
- **Workflow Quality:** Ongoing SRM card audits for newcomers (Cynthia, Joy, Desina, Kibrio, Besserra) plus data accuracy reviews after streams.
- **Account Management:** Reassign inactive LinkedIn accounts, add new ones to bypass connection limits, and confirm phone-number linking rules with Katya.
- **Tool Bugs:** Missing Dropbox data and bot-related glitches reported; ensure re-sync + bug triage.
- **Messaging:** Refine outreach templates via ChatGPT; maintain tone/length standards; remove “not interested” responses.
- **Attendance & Engagement:** Track meeting participation, positive feedback compliance, and ensure balanced workloads regardless of shift start.
- **AI Department Sync:** Prepare updates ahead of the upcoming AI Department meeting; align on file system and analytics expectations.
- **Extension Release (Nov 7):** Distribute the new extension with installation guides, track confirmations, support laggards, and log bugs.
- **Broadcast & Student Monitoring:** Review latest streams/broadcasts, capture timestamps, evaluate engagement, and derive action items.
- **Student/Lead Health:** Review new student cards, monitor technical/academic warning signs, and categorize interventions.
- **LinkedIn & Communications:** Daily LinkedIn monitoring for content/industry news; respond to all pending inbox items across channels.
- **General Support:** Remain on-call for ad-hoc Dropbox, SRM, Wispr Flow, and CRM issues; ensure Wispr Flow transcripts are attached to records.

## Known Issues & Support Queue
- Dropbox access gaps (especially Cynthia) plus managers who still see missing files; require re-authentication and sanity checks.
- Claude AI extension blocked in certain geographies (VPN); prep fallback guidance (Cursor/VS Code alternatives).
- Phone linking policy pending from Katya; without it, LinkedIn account deployment stalls.
- LinkedIn connection limits continue to throttle outreach; need proactive account rotation and monitoring.
- Daily analytics tooling not yet configured; Archibong/Pasichna need to spin up dashboards with input from Artemchuk.
- Positive feedback guideline adoption inconsistent; require coaching and review checkpoints.

## Tools & Systems to Reference
SRM/CRM, Wispr Flow, Dropbox (LG account), Google Workspace, LinkedIn/Sales Navigator, ChatGPT, Claude (where available), Git, VS Code/Cursor, internal message templates, analytics dashboards, internal tech-support chat.

## Deliverable Requirements for the Weekly Plan
Produce a detailed plan for **Monday 10 Nov – Sunday 16 Nov 2025** that:
1. **States Weekly Strategic Intent** — Tie objectives to the evaluation narrative (prove LG’s strategic value, demonstrate analytics rigor, and showcase research/automation leverage). Include success metrics/KPIs for each intent.
2. **Defines Department-Wide Priorities** — Cover SRM accuracy, analytics rollout, LinkedIn/account management, Dropbox/tool stabilization, extension support, message/template governance, AI-dept collaboration, and student/lead monitoring.
3. **Maps Daily Focus (AM/PM blocks)** — For each day, outline concrete activities, dependencies, and expected outputs (e.g., Monday AM: SRM audit sprint for newcomers; Tuesday PM: analytics dashboard QA; Wednesday AM: AI Dept sync prep).
4. **Allocates Resources** — Provide a table assigning each employee (from the roster above) to primary/secondary responsibilities for the week, including capacity notes (e.g., Pasichna split duty, Hanan’s daily China research hour).
5. **Names Cross-Team Dependencies** — Detail touchpoints with AI Dept, Sales, Tech Support, Artemchuk, Katya, etc., including deliverables/documents each dependency expects.
6. **Lists Support & Training Queue** — Track outstanding Dropbox/Claude setups, extension installation confirmations, LK account distribution, and follow-ups for Cynthia, Joy, Desina, Kibrio, Besserra, Olivia, Joel, Hanan, etc.
7. **Includes Risk Register & Mitigations** — Highlight evaluation risk, analytics delays, LinkedIn throttling, setup failures, attendance drift, and VPN/geo-tool blocks with contingency plans.
8. **Specifies Communication & Reporting Cadence** — Daily stand-up/check-in expectations, analytics reporting rhythm, broadcast review summaries, and documentation standards (daily.md, task.md, Whisper Flow links).
9. **Identifies Quality Gates** — Define checkpoints for SRM audits, template reviews, extension rollout verification, and student support interventions before mid-week and end-of-week reviews.
10. **Reserves Reactive Capacity** — Ensure buffer time for ad-hoc escalations (tech issues, urgent lead support) without derailing strategic work.

Format the plan so it is immediately actionable (sections, bullet lists, and tables where helpful). Reference every critical context item above, assign owners, quantify outputs where possible, and ensure the plan can be handed to the team without additional clarification.
