# PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS & METHODOLOGY

## 1. INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES

### Current Problem
Existing training methods are ineffective. The 31-slide presentation is overloaded with complex terminology (*Adherence*, *Workflow Violations*) that employees don't absorb, especially non-native English speakers. This leads to constant reminders and repeated calls.

**Context from Call:**
> "У нас основная проблема заключается в том, что обо всем людям приходится напоминать пять раз. Пять! Десять раз!"
> 
> Translation: "Our main problem is that we have to remind people about everything five times. Five! Ten times!"

### Goal of Redesign
Achieve immediate memorization and understanding of new workflow from first viewing. We are transitioning from **informing** to **associative learning**.

### Secondary Goal
Create quality content that can be repurposed for social media (**LinkedIn**, **YouTube**, **Instagram**, **Facebook**).

---

## 2. KEY METHODOLOGY: ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING

The methodology is based on two principles:

### Principle 1: Storytelling
Information is presented as part of a connected, understandable story.

### Principle 2: Anchoring to Existing Knowledge
New abstract concepts (CRM, file system) are connected to everyday phenomena (cooking, cleaning).

**Context from Call:**
> "Ты прикрепляешь вот эти новые знания к бытовым вопросам, к последовательностям, в надежде, что у них очень быстро уловится эта взаимосвязь."
>
> Translation: "You attach these new knowledge pieces to everyday issues, to sequences, hoping that they quickly grasp this connection."

## 3. MASCOT & CONTINUOUS STORY

### 3.1. Mascot: Humanoid Goat
**Approved mascot** for administrative documentation.

**Character:** A goat living a human life (cooks, cleans, goes shopping) but retaining goat attributes.

### 3.2. Main Story: Preparing Lasagna
An analogy with food preparation is used to explain workflow sequence.

**Plot:**
A male goat calls the female goat and asks her to prepare lasagna. She has never made it before. This story illustrates workflow stages:

| Stage | Goat's Action | Association |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Daily Log** | Records the call and notes "Lasagna" request | Task initiation |
| **Research** | Doesn't know the recipe, searches in "Grandma's Recipe Book" | Finding solution |
| **Deep Search / Plan** | Analyzes recipe, makes shopping list and action plan | Planning |
| **Tasks** | Cooks step by step | Task execution |

---

## 4. LANGUAGE & TERMINOLOGY SIMPLIFICATION

### 4.1. Workflow Terminology Simplification
- Eliminate complex English words (*Adherence*)
- Add simple explanations next to key terms

**Example:**
`Daily Log (Запиши в блокнот 📔)` → "Daily Log (Write in notebook 📔)"

### 4.2. Violation Types Naming Revision
Violation names should be vivid, associative, and memorable. Add emojis.

| Current Name | Associative Formulation | Analogy |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------|
| No Daily Plan / No plans from daily | 🛒 Went shopping without a list | No plan = shopping without notes |
| Not Using Required Tools (e.g., Cursor) | 🍳 Boiled potatoes in a frying pan | Using wrong tool |
| Files not stored in Dropbox / Using personal accounts | 📦 Product not delivered | Result stayed with employee, not delivered to client |

## 5. PRESENTATION RESTRUCTURING & DESIGN

### 5.1. Delivery Methodology

The presentation is divided into two parts:

#### Part 1: How to Do It Right ✅ (First ~25 slides)
The Goat's story of preparing lasagna following the rules.

#### Part 2: How NOT to Do It ❌ + Consequences (Yellow Cards) (After slide ~25)
Mistakes and penalties at the end of presentation.

**Examples of Mistakes:**
- Didn't write down the task → cooks lavash instead of lasagna
- Boils in kettle → uses wrong tool
- Didn't replenish pantry → keeps running to store

### 5.2. Specific Structural Changes

**ADD SLIDES:**
1. **"Research" slide** - between *Daily Log* and *Plan*
2. **"Deep Search/Sink" slide** - separate from *Plan Creation*
3. **"Activity Tracking" slide** - explanation of engagement monitoring
   > "Должно быть 20 нажатий виспрофлоу — будем считать"
   > Translation: "There should be 20 Whisperflow clicks - we'll count them"

**EMPHASIZE:**
- In *Tasks/Plans* section: underscore importance of file links

### 5.3. Design Requirements

**Visual Focus:**
- Images and associations are KEY elements
- **Format:** Full-screen pictures for maximum engagement
- **Consistency:** All slides in uniform style with Goat mascot

**Layout:**
- One concept per slide
- Minimal text overlay on images
- Large, clear fonts
- Emoji integration for quick recognition

## 7. CONTENT ADAPTATION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

### Platforms:
- **LinkedIn** (priority)
- **YouTube**
- **Instagram**
- **Facebook**

### Content Formats:
- **Shorts** (30-60 seconds)
- **Long videos** (3-10 minutes)
- **Posts** with images
- **Carousel posts** with multiple slides

### Content Strategy:
1. Generate scenarios from each slide
2. Create videos using Sora, Veo, or similar AI tools
3. Adapt for different platforms simultaneously
4. Use mascot consistently across all content
5. Post daily on all platforms

---

## 8. MEMORY & LEARNING PRINCIPLES

### Why Associations Work:
1. **Story Connection**: Information presented as narrative
2. **Existing Knowledge Anchor**: New concepts linked to familiar experiences
3. **Visual Memory**: Strong imagery aids recall
4. **Emotional Engagement**: Character-driven stories create emotional connection
5. **Repetition Through Story**: Same character across multiple scenarios reinforces learning

### Implementation:
- Every complex concept must have everyday analogy
- Every violation type must have memorable association
- Every tool/system must have physical world equivalent

---

## 9. QUALITY CRITERIA

A slide is successful if:
✅ Can be understood in 3 seconds
✅ Creates strong visual memory
✅ Employee can recall it without seeing slide again
✅ Can be explained to others easily
✅ Works as standalone social media content

---

## 10. TECHNICAL NOTES

- Original presentation made in Gamma.app
- May transition to HTML/PowerPoint for better flexibility
- Images should be full-screen (not side-by-side layouts)
- Consider interactive elements for web version
- Ensure compatibility across devices
