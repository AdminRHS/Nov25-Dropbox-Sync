## 6. RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### Two-Day Maximum Documentation Rule

**Rule/Practice:** No task or project should go longer than 2 days without full documentation and reporting

**Rationale:** Prevents knowledge loss; ensures rapid feedback; maintains momentum; creates organizational memory while details are fresh

**Application:** All projects and tasks across all departments

**Examples:** "Reporting or projects or tasks that you are taking shouldn't be longer than 2 days long and should be fully processed by the end of the second day including full cycle report"

---

### Always Include Retrospective in Reports

**Rule/Practice:** Every report must include personal vision and answer: "If I would begin doing this task again, how would I do it differently?"

**Rationale:** Captures learning; helps next person doing similar task; identifies process improvements; builds wisdom

**Application:** All project reports, task completions

**Examples:** "Vision report, your own opinion in your own words on your experience during executing this task. Something that you would want people executing this task next time to know"

---

### 125% for Bonus, 100% for Salary

**Rule/Practice:** Basic quota (100%) earns salary; 125% effort earns bonus; creates clear performance tiers

**Rationale:** Motivates extra effort; clear expectations; fair compensation structure; measurable performance

**Application:** All roles with quantifiable outputs (e.g., lead generation 40 baseline, 50 for bonus)

**Examples:** "Daily requirement is 40 leads per day but you can do 50" for bonus; "basic amount of tasks you should fulfill for your salary but if you want bonus you have to get 125 percent"

---

### Small Team Accountability (2-3 People)

**Rule/Practice:** Structure work in small teams of 2-3 people with one team leader for better accountability

**Rationale:** "Report to stakeholders" works better in small teams; clearer responsibility; better communication; manageable coordination

**Application:** All project work, department subgroups

**Examples:** "Reporting calls will be happening among the smaller teams of 2-3 people usually involving one of the team leaders and one of the co-partners co-workers"

---

### Yellow Card Downgrade System

**Rule/Practice:** Poor performance results in yellow card warning; multiple yellow cards downgrade employee in team ranking (lower priority for receiving work orders)

**Rationale:** Fair warning system; performance consequences; opportunity for recovery; cost control (use lower-ranked employees less)

**Application:** All employees after onboarding

**Examples:** "Once they do not do that task properly or assignment properly, they get yellow flags and will be downgraded in the team of those who can receive orders"

---

### Learn from Competitors' Complaints

**Rule/Practice:** Research what users complain about on competitor platforms; use those complaints as your competitive advantages

**Rationale:** Competitors reveal their own weaknesses; user complaints = unmet needs = opportunities; competitive positioning

**Application:** Product development, feature prioritization, marketing messaging

**Examples:** "Scrape the details, comments from all the freelance platforms, identifying their problems, minuses, pluses, what people are complaining and use it as our advantage"

---

### Tourism + English + Internet = Remote Work Market Opportunity

**Rule/Practice:** When researching new geographic markets for remote workers, prioritize countries with: tourism capability (English speakers), good internet infrastructure, lower average salary

**Rationale:** Tourism means English proficiency; internet enables remote work; lower salary means competitive pricing; combination = ideal market

**Application:** International expansion strategy, market research

**Examples:** "Bulgaria has 95% Internet coverage. They have perfect Internet across the country that makes it very attractive for remote work"; "countries with lower average salary but with potential tourism ability of speaking English and good access to Internet"

---

### Detailed Management Through Systems, Not Headcount

**Rule/Practice:** Increase management detail through tracking systems, dashboards, standards, and analytics rather than hiring more managers

**Rationale:** Systems scale; people don't; dashboards provide visibility without overhead; standards create consistency; automation enables small team to manage large organization

**Application:** Company growth strategy, management approach

**Examples:** "Keep amount of people that I would be capable of managing directly. The management should be more detailed. Like I need to build the tracking system dashboard, supporting and everything around it, bringing up the standards, requirements tracking, analytics"

## 7. PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Employee Performance Accountability Unclear

**Description:** No clear warning system or consequences for poor performance; no opportunity for recovery or paid assessment work during slow periods

**Impact:** Quality issues persist; no fair warning before termination; talent underutilized during slow times

**Root Cause:** No performance rating system; no graduated warning approach; full-time or nothing engagement model

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Implement one-week onboarding with ratings
2. Yellow card system for performance issues
3. Downgrade in team ranking for multiple yellow cards (lower priority for work)
4. Paid assessment/test task opportunities (cheaper than full-time)
5. Recovery path through good assessment performance

**Decision Made:** Approved yellow card and assessment system

## 10. DECISIONS LOG

### Decision: Launch Video CV Platform (v-cv.com)

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Context:** Collecting ~100 video interviews/month but only using once for recruitment; opportunity to leverage existing asset more effectively

**Options Considered:**
1. Continue current single-use approach
2. Create dedicated video CV platform for broader distribution

**Decision Made:** Launch v-cv.com platform to double or triple recruitment effectiveness through multi-account distribution

**Rationale:** Maximizes ROI on existing video production; opens new distribution channels; dedicated platform creates professional impression; targets high-demand professions; leverages content already being created

**Impact:** Requires domain purchase, platform development, video element splitting, admin resources (Vilghelm)

**Follow-up Required:** Purchase domain, get finance statistics on current video collection, split existing videos, develop platform, launch with multiple accounts

---

### Decision: Implement Two-Day Documentation Standard

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Context:** Projects completing without documentation; knowledge loss; difficulty learning from past work

**Options Considered:**
1. Continue optional/delayed documentation
2. Mandate 2-day maximum documentation turnaround

**Decision Made:** All tasks/projects must have full documentation by end of day 2

**Rationale:** "The reason of our latest progress is that we have succeeded to implement things much faster due to our taking notes progress" - documentation drives speed; captures knowledge while fresh; enables learning; creates organizational memory

**Impact:** Requires discipline from all team members; team leaders must enforce; multi-platform distribution adds steps; retrospective thinking required

**Follow-up Required:** Create templates, train teams, enforce standard, monitor compliance, iterate based on quality

---

### Decision: Multi-Language International Expansion

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Context:** Limited geographic reach; opportunities in large markets (China, Latin America) and cost-effective markets (Bulgaria-style)

**Options Considered:**
1. Focus on existing markets
2. Systematic expansion through language hiring and research

**Decision Made:** Hire Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish specialists; research Vietnamese and Bulgaria-model countries

**Rationale:** China represents potential "switching point/turning point"; Latin America accessible via Portuguese; Spain via Spanish; Bulgaria model (tourism + English + internet + lower salary) offers competitive advantages; diversifies revenue streams

**Impact:** Hiring costs for language specialists; market research effort; strategy development per region; risk of spreading resources too thin

**Follow-up Required:** HR to hire specialists, research team to evaluate markets, strategy development per region, pilot programs

---

### Decision: Implement Yellow Card Employee Rating System

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Options Considered:**
1. Continue ad-hoc performance management
2. Implement graduated yellow card warning system with assessment opportunities

**Decision Made:** One-week onboarding with ratings, yellow cards for poor performance, downgrade in team ranking, paid assessment task opportunities

**Rationale:** Fair warning before termination; clear performance expectations; cost-effective flexible engagement; recovery path for employees; cheaper to pay for assessments than full-time maintenance

**Impact:** Requires system development, criteria definition, HR enforcement, assessment task creation, payment structure

**Follow-up Required:** Define criteria, build tracking, integrate with onboarding, create assessment system, train HR

---

### Decision: Hire Lead Generation Manager from Recruiting Background

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Options Considered:**
1. Train existing LG staff in recruiting
2. Hire dedicated specialist with both backgrounds

**Decision Made:** Hire one module/specialist with recruiting experience to add to lead generation department

**Rationale:** Recruiting background provides candidate perspective; understands hiring pain points; can better position services; combination of skills valuable for Video CV platform launch

**Impact:** Hiring budget, onboarding time, potential salary premium for specialized skills

**Follow-up Required:** HR to create job description, begin hiring process, onboarding plan

---

### Decision: Build Tracking Dashboard Instead of Hiring More Managers

**Date:** October 30, 2025

**Context:** Growth creating management capacity constraints; need more detail without more managers

**Options Considered:**
1. Hire additional managers
2. Build tracking systems to enable detailed management at scale

**Decision Made:** Prioritize tracking system dashboard with standards, requirements tracking, analytics, and support infrastructure

**Rationale:** Systems scale, people don't; dashboards provide visibility without overhead; "keep amount of people that I would be capable of managing directly" by increasing detail through technology

**Impact:** Development effort, system design, integration work, change management

**Follow-up Required:** Define requirements, build dashboard, establish standards, train managers on system usage

**Impact:** Calendar commitment, preparation time, potential email bonus task for invitations

**Follow-up Required:** Schedule first call this Friday, prepare brief template, send email invitations (bonus), document outcomes

### Decision: Research Freelance Platform Competitive Intelligence

**Date:** October 30, 2025

## 14. KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS

### Taking Notes Accelerates Progress

**Insight:** "The reason of our latest progress is that we have succeeded to implement things much faster due to our taking notes progress. Bravo! Very good job! Now we need to proceed to the next level is sorting those notes out."

**Context:** Reflection on recent company progress and introduction of 2-day documentation standard

**Application:** Documentation isn't overhead, it's acceleration; systematic note-taking enables faster implementation; next level is organizing and using notes, not just taking them

**Related Concepts:** Knowledge management, organizational learning, documentation as competitive advantage

---

### Retrospective Question Drives Continuous Improvement

**Insight:** Every report should answer: "If I would begin doing this task again, how would I do it differently?"

**Context:** Documentation standard requirements including vision report and personal reflection

**Application:** Build retrospective thinking into every task completion; capture improvement ideas while fresh; next person benefits from your learning; compound organizational wisdom over time

**Related Concepts:** Post-mortem analysis, continuous improvement, learning organization, Kaizen

---

### Own Data as Starting Point for Market Research

**Insight:** Use company's own data to identify high-demand professions as starting point for further research; build context before expanding

**Context:** Video CV platform strategy - targeting high-demand professions based on placement data

**Application:** Don't start research from scratch; mine existing data first; internal data reveals actual demand, not theoretical; use as foundation for deeper research

**Related Concepts:** Data-driven strategy, internal analytics, build on what you know

---

### Assessment Model Cheaper Than Full-Time

**Insight:** Engaging employees on paid assessment/test task basis is cheaper than maintaining them full-time; enables flexible capacity

**Context:** Yellow card system allowing downgraded employees to work on paid assessments when employer requirements come in

**Application:** Create tiered engagement model: full-time for core team, assessment-based for extended team; variable costs match variable revenue; maintain talent pool without fixed costs

**Related Concepts:** Flexible workforce, variable cost structure, talent network vs full-time employees

---

### Systems Enable Small Team to Manage Large Organization

**Insight:** "Keep amount of people that I would be capable of managing directly. The management should be more detailed. Like I need to build the tracking system dashboard, supporting and everything around it, bringing up the standards, requirements tracking, analytics"

**Context:** Growth creating management capacity constraints; solution is systems, not more managers

**Application:** Invest in tracking dashboards, standards, analytics, automation before hiring managers; systems provide visibility and control that scales; detailed management through technology, not headcount

**Related Concepts:** Systems thinking, scalable management, automation, technology leverage

---

### Tourism + English + Internet = Remote Work Sweet Spot

**Insight:** Countries with tourism capability (English speakers), good internet infrastructure, and lower average salary represent optimal remote work markets

**Context:** International expansion strategy; Bulgaria example with 95% internet coverage

**Application:** When evaluating new geographic markets, use three criteria: (1) tourism/English proficiency, (2) internet quality, (3) competitive salary levels; combination creates ideal conditions for remote work placement

**Related Concepts:** Market selection criteria, geographic arbitrage, infrastructure requirements

---

### Competitor Complaints Are Your Opportunities

**Insight:** Scraping comments and identifying what people complain about on competitor platforms reveals unmet needs and competitive positioning opportunities

**Context:** Freelance platform research directive

**Application:** Systematic competitive intelligence through user feedback analysis; what competitors do poorly = what you should do well; user complaints = product roadmap priorities; competitive advantage through addressing pain points

**Related Concepts:** Jobs to be done, competitive intelligence, user-driven product development

---

### 125% Baseline Creates Clear Performance Tiers

**Insight:** Setting bonus threshold at 125% of salary baseline creates clear performance tiers and motivation structure

**Context:** Task manager growth score system; example of 40 leads baseline, 50 for bonus

**Application:** Don't make bonus criteria vague; set specific quantifiable thresholds 25% above baseline; creates aspiration that's achievable but requires extra effort; fair and transparent

**Related Concepts:** Performance management, incentive design, quantifiable goals

---

### Video Content Has Multiple Lives, Not One

**Insight:** Video interviews being used once is waste; same content can be split into elements, repackaged, distributed through multiple channels, creating 2-3x value

**Context:** Video CV platform strategy to leverage existing video collection

**Application:** Create content once, use many times; modular content enables remixing; distribution matters as much as creation; maximize ROI on content production through strategic reuse

**Related Concepts:** Content leverage, modular content strategy, multi-channel distribution

---

## 15. ANALOGIES & FRAMEWORKS

### Video Content as Element Library Framework

**Analogy:** Video interviews like LEGO bricks - can be split into individual elements and recombined in multiple ways for different purposes

**Explanation:** Rather than treating each video as monolithic single-use asset, break into component elements (introduction, skill demonstration, portfolio, etc.) that can be reassembled for different contexts

**Application:** Split existing videos into catalogued elements; create element library; enable modular construction for different purposes (full CV, highlight reel, profession-specific showcase, etc.)

---

### 125% Baseline Framework for Bonuses

**Analogy:** Like gym personal records - baseline gets you in the door, but going 25% beyond baseline earns recognition and reward

**Explanation:** Salary baseline represents expected performance (40 leads/day); bonus represents exceeding expectations by significant but achievable margin (50 leads/day = 125%)

**Application:** Set clear baseline for salary; define 125% threshold for bonus; makes performance expectations transparent and achievable; motivates without being unrealistic

---

### Tourism + English + Internet Market Selection Framework

**Analogy:** Like finding the perfect Airbnb - needs good location (English speakers from tourism), good wifi (internet infrastructure), and good price (lower salary costs)

**Explanation:** Three criteria must align: (1) Tourism capability indicates English proficiency (can communicate with international clients), (2) Internet infrastructure enables remote work technically, (3) Lower salary creates pricing advantage

**Application:** Screen potential expansion markets through three-criteria filter; Bulgaria example: 95% internet coverage + tourism economy + competitive salaries = ideal; prioritize markets meeting all three

---

### Small Team with Systems Framework

**Analogy:** Like Formula 1 pit crew - small team with perfect systems, tools, and coordination can service car faster than large disorganized team

**Explanation:** Management capacity not about headcount but about systems quality; detailed management comes from dashboards, standards, tracking, analytics - not from hiring more managers

**Application:** When hitting management capacity limits, build systems before hiring; invest in tracking dashboards, create standards, automate analytics; small well-equipped team outperforms large poorly-equipped team

---

### Yellow Card Warning Framework

**Analogy:** Like soccer/football yellow cards - clear warning system with graduated consequences; accumulate multiple cards = removal from game (downgrade); return in next match with clean slate (assessment opportunities)

**Explanation:** Fair warning approach: first yellow = warning, multiple yellows = downgrade in team ranking (less work priority), assessment tasks = recovery path (proving yourself back in)

**Application:** Issue yellow cards for poor task/assignment execution; track accumulation; downgrade in team ranking after threshold; offer paid assessment tasks as recovery mechanism; cheaper than full-time engagement for lower-ranked employees

---
