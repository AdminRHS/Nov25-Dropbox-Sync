## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Comprehensive week focused on building centralized management systems to replace manual processes. Major initiatives include: implementing Cursor with MCP and Claude Skills across all employees, developing Task Manager as central hub for all projects/microservices/employees, creating video catalog and presentation platform for Academy with AI-generated metadata, redesigning lead generation messaging with structured templates, establishing account management system with employee profile integration, and identifying critical need for AI tool training for UI/UX designers (currently drawing manually instead of using AI generation). The week revealed core insight: "working on the system" (notifications, automation, analysis, rules) rather than manually managing people. Introduced yellow card performance system with Stas as first recipient. Critical blocker: lack of employee profiles prevents AI-assisted task assignment and sales matching.

## 6. RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### Work ON the System, Not IN the System

**Rule/Practice:** Focus energy on building systems (notifications, automation, analysis, rules) rather than manually managing people

**Rationale:** "Very much time spent repeating the same thing to people. People don't remember and don't apply. Checking them takes very much time. This completely removed us from strategic thinking and system development and moved us to level of: hi, why aren't you working, let me watch your screen while fighting with how to click Google Drive button, already forgot what I wanted."

**Application:** When tempted to manually tell someone something, instead build a system that automatically handles it

**Examples:** Instead of reminding people of tasks, build notification system; instead of checking work manually, build automated checking

---

### Yellow Card System - No Exceptions

**Rule/Practice:** Yellow card warning system applies to everyone without exception, even leadership

**Rationale:** Everyone must improve continuously; no special treatment creates fair accountability

**Application:** First yellow card recipient will be Stas (leadership); demonstrates system applies to all

**Examples:** "We won't make exceptions - everyone needs to improve, each of us without exception"

**Rule/Practice:** UI Kits should be centralized reference source, not just documentation PDFs

**Rationale:** Prevents every new designer creating inconsistent designs; maintains brand consistency; enables AI to reference standards during generation

**Application:** Research MCP integration to reference UI Kit during code generation; attach UI Kit to platforms

**Examples:** New designer shouldn't create from scratch; should reference company UI Kit centrally

---

### Cannot Assign Tasks Without Employee Profiles

**Rule/Practice:** "Using hammer to screw bolts and screwdriver to hammer nails because no instruction manual exists for people"

**Rationale:** Without profiles showing skills/experience, wrong people assigned to wrong tasks; causes lost sales and poor quality

**Application:** Build employee profiles before attempting AI-assisted task assignment

**Examples:** Can't ask AI "who knows German?" if profiles don't exist; atomic power plant translator never matched to relevant job because profile doesn't exist

---

### Messaging Must Get Stronger, Not Weaker, in Follow-ups

**Rule/Practice:** Second message must be stronger than first; never weaken in follow-ups

**Rationale:** "If they didn't read first message and first should have been strong, then second saying 'just following up' won't help much - it must be even stronger"

**Application:** Lead with value in follow-up (trial days), not apology

**Examples:** Don't say "follow-up on my last message" - say "Would you like 3 trial days free?"

---

### Third Message = Spam Reports and Bans Only

**Rule/Practice:** Never send third message to same prospect

**Rationale:** "Third message only irritates, they'll complain about our accounts and we'll get more bans"

**Application:** Two messages maximum, then wait 6 months before re-approaching

**Examples:** Better to approach again in 6 months than spam with third message now

---

### Dropbox Must Be Extremely Clean for AI

**Rule/Practice:** Maintain very, very, very structured and clear Dropbox

**Rationale:** AI can only help if files are organized; messy Dropbox = AI can't find anything

**Application:** "Starting from scratch" with new clean Dropbox structure; AI checks if documentation exists before allowing work

**Examples:** "System checks if you have documentation - don't even need to bother going to them [employees]"

---

### First One Who Did Once Will Do Second and Third Time

**Rule/Practice:** "He who did once will do second and third time. Who did 10 times won't fail on 11th. Do it smarter and better each time."

**Rationale:** Repetition builds mastery; life is eternal repetitions from beginning

**Application:** Don't fear starting over; each iteration is better than previous

**Examples:** Task Manager being rebuilt - third or fourth iteration, each better than last

---

### Purchase Accounts on Correct Categories

**Rule/Practice:** When purchasing AI accounts (Claude, Cursor, etc.), specify which category/purpose account serves

**Rationale:** Enables proper tracking, budget allocation, access control

**Application:** Don't just buy "a Claude account" - buy "Claude for lead generation team" or "Claude for dev team"

**Examples:** Finance needs to know which account category to purchase (admin, dev, niko, lead gen, etc.)

## 7. PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: Employees Lost Without Central Dashboard

**Description:** "I sleep and wake up and don't understand where I am, what I'm working on, what's on the agenda" - no central visibility into work; information scattered across GitHub repos, platforms, files; huge effort wasted searching

**Impact:** Lost productivity, confusion, strategic thinking impossible, constant context-switching

**Root Cause:** No centralized management system; work distributed across disconnected platforms

**Proposed Solution:** Build Task Manager / Central Hub showing all projects, microservices, platforms, employees, progress - single source of truth accessible from one place

**Decision Made:** Task Manager is priority project; Kol responsible for task definitions

**Implementation Owner:** Kol Artemchuk (lead), development team

**Status:** Planning - has been discussed for weeks, now formally prioritized

---

### Problem: Cannot Match Employees to Opportunities Without Profiles

**Description:** Lost sales and wrong assignments because can't query employee skills; example: translators with 20 years atomic power plant experience never matched to relevant jobs; copywriters not identified for writing jobs; can't answer "who knows German?"

**Impact:** Massive revenue loss, poor quality work due to wrong people assigned, client dissatisfaction

**Root Cause:** No employee profile system; skills/experience data doesn't exist in searchable form

**Proposed Solution:** Build comprehensive employee profiles in Talents platform with auto-population from Academy completions; enable AI queries

**Decision Made:** Critical priority - has been waiting "months"

**Implementation Owner:** Development team, HR

**Status:** Planning - blocking multiple other initiatives

---

### Problem: UI/UX Designers Drawing Manually Instead of Using AI

**Description:** Leonora and Irina drawing web designs by hand; spent half day learning AI generation tools last time but didn't retain knowledge; no courses/lists/tutorials to reference; "we went two steps backward and doing everything manually again"

**Impact:** Massive productivity loss; slow delivery; outdated approach

**Root Cause:** No systematic training, no documentation, no courses on AI UI/UX generation tools

**Proposed Solution:** Create courses, AI tool lists, video tutorials, prompts, and documentation for UI/UX AI generation; systematic training with reference materials

**Decision Made:** Critical need - should be priority

**Implementation Owner:** Training team, AI tools team

**Status:** Urgent - just identified

---

### Problem: Lead Generation Volume Plateau

**Description:** Top performers achieving results by spamming 300 messages/day without CRM logging; current norm 40-50 leads/day insufficient; need to reach 100/day

**Impact:** Growth limited by manual process bottlenecks; revenue ceiling

**Root Cause:** CRM manual entry is bottleneck; no automation for logging who was contacted

**Proposed Solution:** Multi-phase automation: (1) Extension to auto-log CRM entries, (2) LinkedIn account analysis and AI-powered task assignment, (3) Process optimization via Tango documentation, (4) Increase norm to 50 with path to 100

**Decision Made:** Immediate norm increase to 50; automation development high priority

**Implementation Owner:** Lead generation team (execution), Olya (system design), development team (automation)

**Status:** In progress - norm increase approved, automation planning

---

### Problem: StoryBoard Client at Risk

**Description:** Client project struggling; team needs support; "question of job survival"

**Impact:** Client loss, revenue loss, team jobs at risk

**Root Cause:** Team lacking video editing expertise; no support structure

**Proposed Solution:** Hire video editor immediately as Nastya's assistant; editor learns via Cursor recording, then works with Evelina and Marta; brief team this is survival situation requiring maximum effort

**Decision Made:** Immediate video editor hire approved

**Implementation Owner:** HR (hiring), Nastya (management), video editor (to be hired)

**Status:** Urgent hiring

---

### Problem: No Automation Identification in Processes

**Description:** Don't know which steps can be automated; processes not broken down systematically to find automation opportunities

**Impact:** Manual work continues that could be automated; slow progress

**Root Cause:** No systematic process analysis methodology

**Proposed Solution:** Waterfall process visualization - break work into small columns, evaluate each for automation potential, add report tabs for tracking, iterate

**Decision Made:** Implement waterfall + report tab approach for all departments

**Implementation Owner:** Department leads

**Status:** Framework defined, implementation pending

---

### Problem: AI Subscriptions Untracked and Underutilized

**Description:** Don't know what AI subscriptions exist, what they cost, who has access; potential waste; employees using inferior personal tools instead of company paid subscriptions

**Impact:** Budget waste, underutilization of paid tools, inconsistent capabilities across team

**Root Cause:** No account management system

**Proposed Solution:** Build account management system with categories (LinkedIn separate, Gmail, AI tools, subscriptions), track pricing/validity, control employee access, integrate with profiles

**Decision Made:** Account management system in development

**Implementation Owner:** Development team, Kol

**Status:** Database design in progress

---

### Problem: Strategic Work Impossible Due to Manual Management Overhead

**Description:** "Completely removed from strategic thinking and system development, moved to level of: hi, why aren't you working, watch your screen fighting with Google Drive button, forgot what I wanted"

**Impact:** Leadership stuck in tactical hell; no strategic progress; team not developing

**Root Cause:** No systems for automation, notification, rules, checking

**Proposed Solution:** "Work on the system" - build notifications, automation, analysis, rules instead of manually managing; systems do the managing

**Decision Made:** Fundamental shift to system-building rather than people-managing

**Implementation Owner:** All leadership

**Status:** Philosophical shift in progress

**Impact:** Central hub delayed; employees continue without central visibility

**Waiting On:** Kol to research old docs and define task breakdown

**Resolution Path:** Kol uses Cursor/AI to find old task manager docs in Dropbox, defines requirements, begins MVP

**Priority:** Critical - highest priority project

---

### Employee Profiles Blocked on HR Field Definition

**Description:** Cannot build employee profiles until HR defines required fields and data structure

**Impact:** All AI-assisted assignment blocked; sales matching impossible; skill tracking can't begin

**Waiting On:** HR to specify fields needed; development team to build

**Resolution Path:** HR workshop to define fields, development builds in Talents, Academy integration for auto-population

**Priority:** Critical - "waiting months"

---

### Academy Skills Auto-Population Blocked on Employee Profiles

**Description:** Cannot auto-add skills from lesson completions until employee profiles exist

**Impact:** Manual skill tracking; cannot build comprehensive skill profiles automatically

**Waiting On:** Employee profiles system implementation

**Resolution Path:** Build employee profiles first, then add Academy integration trigger

**Priority:** High - dependent on profiles

---

### Lead Generation Automation Blocked on LinkedIn Export Collection

**Description:** Cannot analyze and build AI-powered task assignment until all LinkedIn exports collected and processed

**Impact:** Manual account management; no optimization; ceiling on leads/day

**Waiting On:** Collection of 20-30 LinkedIn exports

**Resolution Path:** Gather all exports, build database, analyze patterns, create AI task distributor

**Priority:** High - blocks path to 100 leads/day

---

### UI/UX Training Blocked on Course/Material Creation

**Description:** Cannot train designers on AI tools until courses, lists, prompts, documentation created

**Impact:** Designers continue manual work; major productivity loss

**Priority:** High - in development

---

## 14. KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS

### Life is Eternal Repetitions - Each Iteration Better

**Insight:** "Life is eternal repetitions starting from beginning. Who did once will do second and third time. Who did 10 times won't fail on 11th. Do smarter and better each time."

**Context:** Discussion of rebuilding Task Manager again, starting Dropbox structure from scratch

**Application:** Don't fear starting over; each rebuild is better than previous; repetition builds mastery; iteration is growth, not failure

**Related Concepts:** Kaizen, iterative improvement, expertise through repetition, growth mindset

---

### Work ON System, Not IN System

**Insight:** "Very much time spent repeating same thing to people. People don't remember and don't apply. Checking takes very much time. This completely removed us from strategic thinking and system development and moved us to level of: hi, why aren't you working, watch your screen fighting with Google Drive button, forgot what I wanted."

**Context:** Realization that leadership stuck in tactical firefighting instead of strategic system-building

**Application:** When tempted to manually manage people, instead build systems (notifications, automation, rules, checking) that manage automatically; systems scale, manual management doesn't

**Related Concepts:** E-Myth (work ON business not IN business), systems thinking, scalable management, automation mindset

---

### No Instruction Manual = Wrong Tool for Every Job

**Insight:** "Using hammer to screw bolts and screwdriver to hammer nails because no instruction manual exists for people"

**Context:** Lost sales and poor work quality due to inability to match employee skills to tasks without profiles

**Application:** Employee profiles are "instruction manual" for people; without them, random assignment; with them, optimal matching; applies to tools, processes, everything

**Related Concepts:** Documentation importance, knowledge management, skill matching

---

### Follow-up Must Be Stronger Than First Message, Never Weaker

**Insight:** "If they didn't read first message and first should have been strong, then second saying 'just following up' won't help much - it must be even stronger"

**Context:** Lead generation messaging psychology

**Application:** Never apologize or weaken in follow-ups; lead with new value (trial days) not reminder of first message; each touch must be independently compelling

**Related Concepts:** Sales psychology, value ladder, progressive offers

---

### AI Requires Very Clean Structure - Messy Files = Useless AI

**Insight:** Dropbox "must be very, very, very structured and clear" for AI to be effective; messy files mean AI can't help

**Context:** Planning to start Dropbox structure from scratch for AI integration

**Application:** Before integrating AI, clean and structure data/files; AI amplifies structure (clean = super helpful, messy = useless); structure is AI prerequisite

**Related Concepts:** Garbage in garbage out, data hygiene, AI readiness

---

### Learn from YouTube → Transcribe → Execute (Not Written Docs)

**Insight:** "Easiest way to find instructions - not in written text format but Perplexity and YouTube videos, then transcribe videos and step-by-step execute"

**Context:** Learning MCP and AI agent integration

**Application:** For technical learning, video tutorials often better than written docs; use AI to transcribe to text for step-by-step execution; millions of tutorials available

**Related Concepts:** Multi-modal learning, AI-assisted learning, video as primary documentation

---

### Central Hub Eliminates "Where Am I?" Problem

**Insight:** "I sleep and wake up not understanding where I am, what I'm working on, what's on agenda" - scattered platforms cause disorientation; central hub solves this

**Context:** Justification for Task Manager priority

**Application:** When work spread across too many disconnected tools, build central hub first; single entry point with everything accessible; dramatically reduces cognitive load and wasted time

**Related Concepts:** Cognitive load, tool consolidation, single source of truth

---

### Waterfall Columns + Report Tabs = Systematic Process Improvement

**Insight:** Breaking work into small waterfall columns, checking each for automation, adding quantitative report tabs enables systematic iteration and improvement

**Context:** Process optimization methodology for all departments

**Application:** Any process can be improved by: (1) visualize as sequential columns, (2) evaluate each for automation, (3) add daily quantitative tracking, (4) iterate; old report file templates with formulas already exist in Google Drive

**Related Concepts:** Process mapping, continuous improvement, data-driven optimization

---

### Third Message = Spam Reports and Bans, Not Conversions

**Insight:** "Third message only irritates, they'll complain about our accounts and we'll get more bans"

**Context:** Lead generation sequence decisions

**Application:** Two touches maximum, then wait 6 months; third touch damages more than helps; better to wait and re-approach fresh than spam

**Related Concepts:** Diminishing returns, anti-spam compliance, long-term relationship building

---

### Cursor Screen Share = Automatic Onboarding and Documentation

**Insight:** Junior/assistant can sit with senior via Cursor screen share; AI follows along, records everything, builds context automatically; eliminates manual knowledge transfer

**Context:** Video editor onboarding plan for Nastya

**Application:** All onboarding and training should happen via Cursor with screen share; AI assistant observes and documents automatically; dramatically faster knowledge transfer

**Related Concepts:** AI-assisted onboarding, automatic documentation, apprenticeship 2.0

---

## 15. ANALOGIES & FRAMEWORKS

### Instruction Manual for People (Employee Profiles)

**Analogy:** Employee profiles are like instruction manuals for tools - without manual, you use hammer to screw bolts and screwdriver to hammer nails; with manual, right tool for every job

**Explanation:** Just as tools need manuals showing what they do and how to use them, employees need profiles showing skills/experience/capabilities so they can be matched to right tasks

**Application:** Build comprehensive employee profiles with searchable skills; enables "read the manual" (query profile) before assigning task

---

### Waterfall Columns Analogy

**Analogy:** Work flow like waterfall - flows through sequential columns/steps

**Explanation:** Breaking process into visible sequential steps (columns) allows examining each step individually for time, automation potential, quality

**Application:** Visualize any department's work as columns; evaluate each column; add report tabs to track flow through waterfall

---

### System as Manager Instead of Person as Manager

**Analogy:** Shift from "person checks if work done" to "system checks if work done automatically"

**Explanation:** Manual management doesn't scale; systems do the notification, checking, reminding, enforcement; humans do strategic work

**Application:** For every repetitive management task, build system to handle it; free humans for strategy

---

## 16. FOLLOW-UP ITEMS
