## Blockers to Address

### Potential Blockers
1. **Dashboard Analytics Implementation Access**: May need access to production environment or staging to implement security improvements
   - Action: Verify access permissions and request staging environment if needed
   - Priority: High

2. **Testing Environment for Green Cards**: Need to ensure testing environment has proper database setup for green_cards table
   - Action: Verify database schema and test data availability
   - Priority: High

3. **Time Allocation**: Multiple courses and projects may require better time management
   - Action: Use time-blocking technique learned from courses to organize tomorrow's schedule
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Knowledge Application**: Need to bridge gap between learning and practical application of new tools
   - Action: Create specific tasks that directly use NotebookLM and Gemini AI features
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Course Completion**: Some courses were started but not completed
   - Action: Schedule dedicated time to complete remaining course modules
   - Priority: Low

### No Critical Blockers Identified
All major blockers are manageable. Ready to proceed with planned work and apply learned skills.
