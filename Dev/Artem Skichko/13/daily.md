### [14:05-16:34] - [Dashboard Green Cards Feature Implementation]

**What I worked on:**

- Created SQL script for `green_cards` table with Foreign Key relationship to `employees` table
- Modified Leaderboard ranking logic to sort employees by number of green cards instead of days without yellow cards
- Added visual representation for green cards in employee profile modal (matching yellow cards design)
- Fixed date formatting in Leaderboard table to display dates in readable YYYY-MM-DD format
- Fixed tab switching issue: clicking employees in Leaderboard now opens modal without switching to Team tab
- Added dark theme support for green card visualizations
- Updated badges system in Leaderboard to show green card achievements (⭐ 10+, 5+, 3+ cards)

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Started working on implementing the Green Cards feature for the Dashboard application. First, I created a comprehensive SQL script (`sqript.md`) for the `green_cards` table. The script includes table creation with proper Foreign Key constraints linking to the `employees` table using `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` for data integrity. Added indexes for performance optimization and included detailed comments and usage examples.

Next, I modified the Leaderboard functionality. The previous implementation ranked employees by days without yellow cards, but the requirement was to rank by the number of green cards received. I updated the `renderLeaderboard()` function in `lib/render-stats.js` to calculate `greenCardsCount` for each employee and sort the leaderboard accordingly. Updated the table headers and descriptions to reflect the new ranking criteria. Modified the period filters to work with green cards data instead of violation dates.

I then implemented visual representation for green cards in the employee profile modal. Previously, green cards were displayed as a simple number, while yellow cards had a visual card stack design. I added the same visual treatment for green cards using the `card-green` class with stack shapes (`stack-dark`, `stack-medium`, `stack-light`) that appear based on the number of cards (1, 2, or 3+). Added corresponding CSS styles and dark theme support to match the existing yellow cards design.

Fixed date formatting issues in the Leaderboard table. Dates were displaying in full ISO format (e.g., "2025-11-13T00:00:00.000Z") instead of readable format. I implemented date parsing and formatting logic to convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format, handling various input formats (ISO strings, Date objects, etc.).

Resolved a navigation issue where clicking on an employee in the Leaderboard table would switch to the Team tab before opening the modal. I removed the `switchTab()` call from the `navigateToEmployee()` function, allowing the modal to open while staying on the current tab (Leaderboard).

Updated the badges system in Leaderboard to show green card achievements with star emojis (⭐ 10+ cards, ⭐ 5+ cards, ⭐ 3+ cards) instead of the previous streak-based badges.

**Outcomes:**

- Successfully created comprehensive SQL script for `green_cards` table with proper database relationships
- Leaderboard now correctly ranks employees by green cards count (highest first)
- Green cards have visual representation matching yellow cards design in employee profile modal
- Dates in Leaderboard display in clean YYYY-MM-DD format instead of ISO strings
- Fixed navigation: clicking employees in Leaderboard opens modal without switching tabs
- Added dark theme support for all green card visualizations
- Updated badges to reflect green card achievements
- Improved overall user experience with consistent visual design across card types
- All changes tested and verified to work correctly across different scenarios
- Total implementation time: 149 minutes (14:05-16:34)
