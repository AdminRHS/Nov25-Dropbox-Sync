### [8:30-9:19] - [Improving Dashboard app]
**What I worked on:**
- Switched from using ChatGPT to Claude for creating prompts for Cursor to improve implementation quality
- Fixed scrolling issues: resolved problems with automatic scrolling to the top when switching between months in the dashboard
- Debugged and tested the month navigation functionality to ensure smooth user experience
- Improved overall dashboard app stability and user interface behavior

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
Started working on the Dashboard app improvements at 8:30 AM. I encountered some implementation problems with the current approach. Previously, I was using ChatGPT for creating prompts for Cursor, but I decided to switch to Claude for creating prompts. I'm hoping this will help improve the implementation quality and reduce errors. I began testing Claude's prompt generation capabilities and found it provides more structured and detailed prompts. 

Next, I focused on fixing the scrolling issues. The problem was that when switching between months in the dashboard, the page was automatically scrolling to the top, which was disrupting the user experience. I investigated the month navigation component and identified the root cause - an event handler was triggering a scroll event on month change. I modified the event handling logic to prevent the automatic scroll. I tested the fix across different scenarios: switching from January to February, jumping to December, and navigating through multiple months sequentially. The scrolling behavior is now smooth and maintains the user's position when possible. I also improved the overall stability of the dashboard app by fixing some edge cases in the UI behavior. Completed testing and verification at 9:19 AM.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully switched from ChatGPT to Claude for prompt generation, resulting in better quality prompts
- Fixed the scrolling issue: dashboard no longer jumps to top when switching months
- Improved month navigation functionality with smooth transitions
- Enhanced overall dashboard app stability and user experience
- Reduced implementation errors through better prompt engineering with Claude
- Verified the fix works correctly across all navigation scenarios

- Added keyboard accessibility support (Enter key) and proper cursor styling
- Implemented dark/light theme support with accent colors

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
Started working on a new feature for the portfolio website at 14:33. The task was to add an animated circle transition effect for the "Live Demo" button. I began by analyzing the requirements: the circle should appear on hover, follow the mouse cursor, and expand from the click point to cover the entire screen when clicked.

First, I created a new component called `AnimatedLink.tsx`. I used React hooks including `useState` for managing animation states (`isHovered`, `isExpanding`, `circlePosition`, `circleScale`), `useRef` for tracking the link element, and `useEffect` for handling cleanup and visibility changes. The component needed to track mouse position for the hover effect and click coordinates for the expansion animation.

I implemented the hover effect first. When the mouse enters the button area, a small circle appears at the cursor position with `scale(1.2)` and `opacity(0.7)`. I added `onMouseMove` handler to make the circle follow the cursor in real-time. The circle uses `position: fixed` with `z-index: 9999` to appear above all other elements.

For the click animation, I captured the click coordinates using `e.clientX` and `e.clientY`, then animated the circle to expand from that exact point. I calculated the maximum scale needed to cover the entire screen using `Math.max(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight) * 2.5`. The animation duration is 700ms with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` easing function.

I encountered several issues during implementation. The first problem was that links were opening in a new tab instead of the current one. I fixed this by changing `external={true}` to `external={false}` in the ProjectCard component. The second issue was that the circle wasn't disappearing after navigation - I added a `visibilitychange` event listener to clean up the state when the page changes.

Another problem was that the circle wasn't appearing on hover. I discovered this was due to a condition checking `circlePosition.x > 0` which was blocking the render. I removed this check and wrapped the link in a div with proper event handlers to ensure hover events fired correctly.

The biggest challenge was dealing with `overflow: hidden` on parent elements, which was preventing the circle from expanding beyond the project card boundaries. I solved this by using React Portal (`createPortal` from `react-dom`) to render the circle directly in `document.body`, completely outside the component's DOM hierarchy. This allowed the circle to expand freely across the entire screen.

I also added visual enhancements: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for the expanding circle and `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` for the hover state. I implemented dark/light theme support by checking for the `dark` class and using appropriate colors: `rgba(59, 130, 246, ...)` for light theme and `rgba(56, 189, 248, ...)` for dark theme.

For accessibility, I added keyboard support with `onKeyDown` handler for Enter key and `tabIndex={0}`. I also set `pointerEvents: 'none'` on the circle to prevent it from blocking interactions, and added `cursor: pointer` to the button.

The final implementation uses `transform: scale()` for optimal performance, as it's GPU-accelerated and doesn't trigger layout reflows. The circle smoothly follows the cursor on hover and expands beautifully from the click point to cover the entire screen with a blur effect. Completed the implementation at 15:35.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully created `AnimatedLink.tsx` component with full animation functionality
- Implemented smooth circle hover effect that follows mouse cursor in real-time

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
Started working on the AI-Driven MCP Service Generation Checklist course at 16:05. This course focused on building a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) service from scratch. The goal was to create a production-ready service that could be deployed and used via npx.

I began by understanding the architecture requirements. The service needed to be a standalone Node.js process with MCP-compatible server using stdio transport. I set up the core file structure with modular components: index.js as the main entry point, config.js for environment configuration, auth.js for token management, api-client.js for HTTP requests using node-fetch, handlers.js for tool implementations, tools.js for tool definitions, and schemas.js for input validation.

The authentication system was crucial. I implemented support for API_TOKEN environment variable, created a username/password login tool, added token refresh capabilities, and ensured secure credential handling by adding .gitignore for sensitive files. The auth.js module manages tokens in memory without persisting sensitive data.

I implemented all required MCP tools: get_entity for retrieving entities, create_entity for creating new entities, update_entity for updating existing entities, delete_entity for removing entities, get_reference for fetching reference data, login for authentication, and refresh_token for token management. Each tool has proper input validation through schemas.js and error handling.

The HTTP integration was built using node-fetch. I implemented request/response processing, proper error handling with timeouts, and API endpoint management. The api-client.js handles all HTTP communication with the external API, including proper headers and authentication.

I created comprehensive documentation including README.md with complete documentation, DEPLOYMENT.md with GitHub deployment guide, PROJECT_REVIEW.md with architecture review, QUICK_START.md for quick start instructions, and SUMMARY.md with project overview. All documentation includes installation instructions, environment variable setup, MCP server integration guide, usage examples, and API documentation.

I set up the project structure with proper package.json configuration including bin field for CLI support, added shebang to index.js for direct execution, configured all dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, node-fetch), and created test-local.js for local testing.

The deployment process involved initializing git repository, committing all files, setting up GitHub remote, and pushing to Artemida1609/mcp-service. The service is now available via npx github:Artemida1609/mcp-service.

I verified all requirements: standalone Node.js process, MCP-compatible server, CLI mode support, modular file structure, environment configuration, authentication methods, all MCP tools, HTTP integration, proper file structure, and comprehensive documentation. The project status is PRODUCTION READY. Completed the course at 16:28.

**Outcomes:**
