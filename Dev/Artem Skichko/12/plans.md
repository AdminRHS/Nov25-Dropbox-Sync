## Blockers to Address

### Potential Blockers
1. **MCP Service Testing**: Need access to MCP client or test environment to verify service functionality
   - Action: Set up local MCP client or request access to testing environment
   - Priority: High

2. **Notion Account Setup**: May need to complete Notion account setup if not already done
   - Action: Verify account access and complete any pending setup steps
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Time Management**: Multiple courses and projects may require better time allocation
   - Action: Use Notion to create time-blocked schedule for tomorrow
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Knowledge Application Gap**: Need to bridge gap between learning and practical application
   - Action: Create specific tasks that directly apply learned skills
   - Priority: Low

### No Critical Blockers Identified
All major blockers from today have been resolved. Ready to proceed with planned work.
