## Executive Summary

The Design department is the **first department successfully onboarded** to Remote Helpers' new AI-assisted file system and automated daily planning workflow. The team participated in hands-on training on November 4th, learning to use VS Code/Cursor with Claude Code extension and Whisper Flow transcription for automated documentation generation.

**Achievement:** Design department serves as pilot and success template for file system rollout to all other departments.

**Key Initiatives:**
- **AI-Assisted Daily Planning:** Automated workflow reduces administrative overhead by 60-80%
- **Technical Setup Completion:** Rolling out VS Code/Cursor + Claude extensions to all 9 designers
- **Transcript Processing:** Record → Transcribe → Paste → AI generates Plans.md & Tasks.md
- **Quality Testing:** Validating Whisper Flow accuracy and AI-generated output quality

**Workflow:** Team members only need to paste transcripts - AI handles all analysis, structuring, categorization, and task extraction.

**Team Members:** 10 designers across UI/UX, Graphic Design, and Illustration specializations

### MEDIUM (Near Term - 1-2 weeks)

#### 3. Test Transcript Quality and Accuracy
- **Owner:** Design Team Members (Testing), Artemchuk Nikolay (Quality Review)
- **Department:** Design, AI
- **Profession:** All Design team members
- **Timeline:** During first week of usage
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Dependencies:** Team members completing setup
- **Related Project:** Daily Workflow Automation
- **Tools:** Whisper Flow, VS Code/Cursor with Claude

**Context:** Testing revealed issues with automatic transcription accuracy during Design call. Whisper Flow sometimes produces garbled transcriptions. Known bug: if English audio detected, entire transcript switches to English even for Russian conversation. Inaccuracies lead to incorrect AI-generated plans/tasks.

**Testing Focus Areas:**
1. **Transcription Accuracy:** How often does Whisper Flow correctly transcribe?
2. **Language Switching Bug:** Does transcript inappropriately switch to English?
3. **AI Plan Generation:** Are Plans.md accurate based on actual meeting content?
4. **AI Task Extraction:** Are Tasks.md complete and correctly prioritized?
5. **Edge Cases:** Long meetings, multiple speakers, technical terminology

**Steps:**
1. Each designer records their daily meetings/work sessions
2. Transcribe using Whisper Flow
3. Manually review transcript for accuracy before processing
4. Paste transcript into daily.md file
5. Let AI generate Plans.md and Tasks.md
6. Compare AI output with actual meeting content
7. Document any inaccuracies or issues
8. Report findings to Artemchuk Nikolay
9. Identify patterns in errors
10. Provide feedback on transcript quality issues

**Known Issues to Track:**
- Garbled transcriptions (frequency and patterns)
- Language switching from Russian to English mid-transcript
- Technical terminology misrecognition
- Multiple speaker attribution problems
- AI misinterpreting unclear transcripts

## AI-Assisted Daily Planning Workflow

### The Workflow (Simplified)

**For Designers - 3 Simple Steps:**
1. **Record** your meeting or work session (audio)
2. **Transcribe** using Whisper Flow (copy transcript)
3. **Paste** into daily.md file (AI does the rest automatically)

**What AI Does Automatically:**
- Analyzes transcript for tasks, plans, decisions
- Generates structured Plans.md (daily planning)
- Generates structured Tasks.md (action items with priorities)
- Categorizes by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Extracts deadlines, dependencies, and resources

**Designer Benefit:**
- **Before:** Manually write meeting notes, extract tasks, organize plans (30-60 minutes daily)
- **After:** Paste transcript, AI generates everything (2-5 minutes daily)
- **Time Savings:** 60-80% reduction in administrative overhead
- **Quality:** Consistent formatting, nothing forgotten, priorities clear

### Tools Used

**Primary Options:**
1. **VS Code + Claude Code Extension** (Official Anthropic extension)
   - Free, widely adopted, extensible
   - "Plan Mode" with Shift+Tab
   - @ mention or drag-drop files for context

2. **Cursor IDE** (Alternative)
   - Similar Claude integration
   - "Composer 1" model selection
   - Slightly faster for some workflows

**Support Tools:**
- **Whisper Flow:** Audio transcription (record meetings to text)
- **Git Bash:** Required system component
- **Admin Claude Account:** Company account (centralized budget, no personal charges)

### Workflow Standards

**Company Policies:**
- ✅ Use Admin Claude account (not personal accounts)
- ✅ Coordinate 2FA access through Kovalska Anastasiya
- ✅ Monitor session limits (don't exceed credits)
- ✅ Validate transcript quality before processing
- ✅ Report issues to Artemchuk Nikolay

**Best Practices:**
- Record clear audio (minimize background noise)
- Speak clearly during meetings (improves transcription)
- Review transcript before pasting (catch garbled sections)
- Validate AI output (ensure plans/tasks match actual meeting)
- Provide feedback (help improve the system)
