## Executive Summary

The Design department is the **first department successfully onboarded** to Remote Helpers' new AI-assisted file system and automated daily planning workflow. The team participated in hands-on training on November 4th, learning to use VS Code/Cursor with Claude Code extension and Whisper Flow transcription for automated documentation generation.

**Key Initiatives:**
- **AI-Assisted Daily Planning:** Automated workflow reduces administrative overhead by 60-80%
- **Technical Setup Completion:** Rolling out VS Code/Cursor + Claude extensions to all 9 designers
- **Transcript Processing:** Record → Transcribe → Paste → AI generates Plans.md & Tasks.md
- **Quality Testing:** Validating Whisper Flow accuracy and AI-generated output quality

**Workflow:** Team members only need to paste transcripts - AI handles all analysis, structuring, categorization, and task extraction.

**Team Members:** 10 designers across UI/UX, Graphic Design, and Illustration specializations

## AI-Assisted Daily Planning Workflow

### The Workflow (Simplified)

**For Designers - 3 Simple Steps:**
1. **Record** your meeting or work session (audio)
2. **Transcribe** using Whisper Flow (copy transcript)
3. **Paste** into daily.md file (AI does the rest automatically)

**What AI Does Automatically:**
- Analyzes transcript for tasks, plans, decisions
- Generates structured Plans.md (daily planning)
- Generates structured Tasks.md (action items with priorities)
- Categorizes by priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Extracts deadlines, dependencies, and resources

**Designer Benefit:**
- **Before:** Manually write meeting notes, extract tasks, organize plans (30-60 minutes daily)
- **After:** Paste transcript, AI generates everything (2-5 minutes daily)
- **Time Savings:** 60-80% reduction in administrative overhead
- **Quality:** Consistent formatting, nothing forgotten, priorities clear

### Tools Used

**Primary Options:**
1. **VS Code + Claude Code Extension** (Official Anthropic extension)
   - Free, widely adopted, extensible
   - "Plan Mode" with Shift+Tab
   - @ mention or drag-drop files for context

2. **Cursor IDE** (Alternative)
   - Similar Claude integration
   - "Composer 1" model selection
   - Slightly faster for some workflows

**Support Tools:**
- **Whisper Flow:** Audio transcription (record meetings to text)
- **Git Bash:** Required system component
- **Admin Claude Account:** Company account (centralized budget, no personal charges)

### Workflow Standards

**Company Policies:**
- ✅ Use Admin Claude account (not personal accounts)
- ✅ Coordinate 2FA access through Kovalska Anastasiya
- ✅ Monitor session limits (don't exceed credits)
- ✅ Validate transcript quality before processing
- ✅ Report issues to Artemchuk Nikolay

**Best Practices:**
- Record clear audio (minimize background noise)
- Speak clearly during meetings (improves transcription)
- Review transcript before pasting (catch garbled sections)
- Validate AI output (ensure plans/tasks match actual meeting)
- Provide feedback (help improve the system)

## Design Department Success Story

### November 4, 2025 - Milestone Achievement

**Event:** First department-wide file system training
**Duration:** Approximately 40-50 minutes
**Participants:** 5 designers + Artemchuk Nikolay (AI Lead) + Panchenko Diana (Video)
**Outcome:** Successful pilot deployment, Yuliia completed full setup
**Note:** Syrotiuk Mariia joined the team after this training session

**What Made It Successful:**
1. **Hands-On Training:** Live setup during call, real-time troubleshooting
2. **Pilot User:** Yuliia tested complete workflow during call
3. **Video Recording:** Training captured for future distribution
4. **Team Enthusiasm:** All designers enthusiastic about simplified workflow
5. **Immediate Value:** Clear 60-80% admin time savings demonstrated

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Git Bash installation requirement
- Admin account authentication with 2FA coordination
- Session limit awareness
- Transcript quality issues identified

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Need simplified setup instructions (not 1.5 hour process)
2. Transcript quality validation important before processing
3. Language switching bug needs investigation
4. Admin account coordination manageable but needs process
5. Both VS Code and Cursor work well (designer preference)

**Template for Other Departments:**
Design department's success provides roadmap for LG (next), HR, Dev, and other departments. Key factors: hands-on training, pilot users, video documentation, immediate value demonstration, troubleshooting support.
