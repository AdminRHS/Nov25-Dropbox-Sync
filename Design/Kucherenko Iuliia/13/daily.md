## Activities


### Morning - Team Discussion: Electricity Issues & Flexible Work Arrangements
**What I worked on:**
- Discussed Masha's electricity problems and potential solutions (coworking spaces, cafes)
- Reviewed flexible schedule options for employees affected by power outages
- Discussed compensation for coworking/cafe expenses
- Addressed screenshot submission and tracking issues for remote work verification

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
"Yesterday on our call, Masha was on the agenda - she has electricity problems. Kolia didn't refuse, he said that if she works on the project, the company can pay for a coworking space for 4800. But maybe a battery? Batteries are unlikely - Ecofon won't send them, that's too expensive. Maybe we have spare laptops with removable batteries? Maybe she can get by on two batteries, two hours each, if one is charging. But hers doesn't detach. I'm talking about those that do detach. But there are very few good laptops where batteries actually detach. I don't know, earlier this was an option - buy three batteries, that would be enough for even eight hours of work. But now that's not an option. It would last for some days, but then it's unclear what will happen.

So Masha, who works on Mostika, is now in question. She's been silent for a week. She should already be working paid hours, and she has terrible electricity problems. We talked with Kolia yesterday about this. She wrote to me yesterday - she said it's very far to the coworking space, about 40 minutes plus. She says if it rains now, you can't carry a laptop - it could get wet. She doesn't have a carrying case. Anyway, we agreed that she would look for where to work on Monday and report back. We allowed a flexible schedule - as long as she works her hours, but she needs to be on all calls with Mostika because they have 2-hour calls, so she needs to be on at least those calls.

She said she'll work in 2-3 cafes, asked permission to work from cafes, and we said OK. But she'll have problems with Discord and RNC, and most likely will be late with screenshots and such. We talked with Kolia yesterday - Kolia said maybe we can pay something, I don't know how to add it to salary, something for the cafe. We need to find out how much we should pay for this.

And how to check the tracker - I don't know if you came up with something for this or not. Not yet, actually. We're now conducting a survey of all employees. I'm hearing for the first time now that there are electricity problems. No one writes about weekends, you think calmly that this doesn't affect anyone. But in the east, in Kharkiv, there's a question. And based on the survey, we wanted to implement some solutions. But it turns out only Masha works on projects and has a problem. Mainly foreigners - Norway, Marina, Shaira in Netherlands, Austria - we have Sofia, Nastia, I don't remember who else, from Odesa we checked, she said she has no problems with electricity at all, although Odesa is being shelled. And those in western Ukraine also have no problems. Hotels are also fine. Only Kharkiv - that's all, it's terrible there. We have Masha who works there - it's the worst. She can have no electricity for 16 hours. The only thing that saves her is that her laptop holds for two hours plus a power bank nearby. But Polina said yesterday when I talked with her, he said yes, of course, she can work from cafes. I understand she'll work from practice.

We want some flexible solution not only for those on projects. We need feedback from everyone, but we'll develop some solution faster. While this data collection is going on, and searching for compromises. That flexible schedule is definitely needed. The only nuance is that it can't be uncontrolled - at minimum there should be standards. If it's a designer, that's also work, a person should work, yes. And that they work out these hours when there's an opportunity. And plus you're talking about screenshots - we'll need to discuss with Stas today. Maybe there will be some solution today already.

We were thinking about making it tied to both CRM and Discord. For example, if you don't send a screenshot in CRM for a long time, maybe CRM won't work. At least in Discord, there should be a log in the channel. And if Discord also doesn't work, then I don't know what solution can be made. You know what problem there is? Sometimes like with Dasha, for example. We have Dasha again, she's also in Kharkiv. And sometimes there's no connection. You can't even call her. They have no electricity and no connection. So even that option. Dasha's situation is a bit easier - she has a tablet that holds for 10 hours. So in that sense... So look, in such cases we can... Kolia wrote to you: Dasha! Answer! I see! Where are you? We're sitting in the channel! From designers! Ah, she's not officially in private messages, just... So that everyone sees! Everyone! So in such cases, I'm saying: if they drag out all these things, then we'll probably rely on reports. But it turns out we only have problems with Dasha, with Maria. And with Sviat sometimes, occasionally. Three of us have such problems. With Maria, I don't know what can really be done. I also don't know how she goes to cafes. Should we immediately send her money for a cup of tea? Of course she won't sit in a cafe eating. If it's a cafe, if there's a coworking option, we're working on that - we're gathering information about how much coworking spaces cost approximately by city, and in principle I think we'll compensate this amount if she prefers, if it's easier for her to do it in a cafe, and if she's not against it, of course we'll allocate some amount. For opening needs. In a cafe. So it's not like that. So this is all in work? Yes, we'll bring profit to local businesses, cafes. But we need to support them. There's no other way. So then Dasha, when you decide something, find out, tell us. OK, have a good day. When there's a solution, I'll let you know so we can also tell what and how."

**Outcomes:**
- Agreed to flexible work schedules for employees affected by electricity outages
- Company will compensate coworking space costs (approximately 4500-4800 UAH)
- Employees can work from cafes with company approval
- Need to develop tracking solution for flexible schedules (CRM + Discord integration)
- Surveying all employees about electricity issues to develop comprehensive solution

### Mid-Morning - Video Production Discussion: Subtitle Placement
**What I worked on:**
- Discussed subtitle placement preferences for video content
- Reviewed YouTube best practices for subtitle positioning
- Considered visual design impact of subtitle placement

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
"Purely visually, of course, I would put them at the bottom. Yes, as we're more used to. 200 pixels from the bottom so it doesn't overlap, and then subtitles go. Yes, as usual. But there are those who put them right in the center. I don't know, that's idiocy in my opinion. No, but I looked, probably in the center they don't put subtitles, but when they make text there. It looks like a subtitle, but probably that's planned when the text is like that. I once had a video where I really wanted to make them at the top. Because at the bottom it was covering some important details for me. And they were hard to see. Yes, well I just decided that you can't put subtitles everywhere - subtitles always go at the bottom. Look at YouTube, in these horizontal videos, they always go at the bottom. There's something I'm leading..."

"Where did you upload this? To YouTube? Uploaded to YouTube or where are you leading? Well, to YouTube, probably. Some glitch they have there. Ah, by the way, today I watched some news that Google sued Gemini. Because it uses personal data of these people. But, but, but... Well I don't remember who. Sued Google. No, no, no, this is Google suing Gemini, I think. Well anyway, earlier Gemini was just standing there, and now you need to turn it off because it's enabled by default. Ah yes? Well I literally read that yesterday. So that's how it is, unclear."

**Original (Russian/Ukrainian):**
[Original transcript from lines 33-35]


**Outcomes:**
- Decided to use standard bottom placement for subtitles (200px from bottom)
- Confirmed YouTube best practices alignment
- Noted exception cases where top placement might be needed for visual clarity

### Mid-Day - Course Thumbnail Review Session
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed multiple course thumbnails for Academy
- Identified images needing redesign (non-informative, missing context)
- Discussed icon placement and visual clarity requirements
- Reviewed AI-generated images and their quality issues
- Addressed specific thumbnail issues (numbers, icons, text clarity)

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
[Key excerpts from the extensive thumbnail review discussion]

"Victoria: I made this line on two elements full width, because otherwise it shows incorrectly. That's how he decided to do it for me. And this isn't the first time he generates such things for me. That is, what- Liliia: The best design that could only be. Victoria: Yes. Liliia: It happens, it happens. Victoria: Beauty! Liliia: Maybe they'll release some update now? So that it will work normally this way? Maybe. Yes, because I remember this with GPT-chat constantly, when before some update about a month in advance, the dances with tambourine begin. Yes, you can't say it differently, yes."

"Scenarios if writing - I tried Perplexity, ChatGPT and Gemini in the same format - Gemini handled it best among them, it somehow approached my task more consciously, studied the topic deeply and wrote, although earlier I liked Perplexity more, but it turns out you need to really use everything, use everything and see everything, where it's better, because each task works differently, who's better."

**Original (Russian/Ukrainian):**
[Original transcript from lines 37-47]


**Outcomes:**
- Identified 6+ thumbnails requiring redesign (numbers 2, 6, and others)
- Noted issues with icon placement and visual clarity
- Decided to review and fix non-informative images
- Documented specific requirements: images must clearly convey text content
- Created list of thumbnails needing revision for follow-up work

### Afternoon - Presentation Issues Review: Gravestones & Map Corrections
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed presentation slides with inappropriate gravestone imagery
- Identified Russia map issues in company presentations
- Discussed removal of Russia from company materials
- Coordinated fixes for multiple presentation files

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
"No, but how is it set on the grave in advance, on a person where only the date of birth is written, and then the date of death. This is yes. Yes-yes-yes. I thought so. Look, there's no date of death, something's not right, but OK. Well. OK, this is easy to fix, really. Yes-yes-yes. We somehow didn't even pay attention to this. And there's only the first frame like that. Also the first-second slide, I think, yes. And such a thing, yes, also in another presentation. There's the last Google Drive, if anything, it exists. But in the first presentation it's normal, on the pointer you can see that it's not a gravestone slab. But the last one you sent me two - these are the same, they seem like no, different, yes Google Drive, look, you have all three uploaded at once, the last link somehow on the floor, this is one, two, three, even folders will be, need to look yourself, and this will turn out Drive for all three presentations, these yes, give them in different formats, yes this when he borders the presentation, well yes, some, some he borders, some there we redid, I think there was with a cat, then they wanted a white bear, so we redid, we gave them this, yes yes, they definitely have it, and even faster they would find what we did last time."

"No more, yes, we'll need to really redo this slide for the presentation, honestly, I'll send these gravestone slabs to chat, we really didn't even think about this. So here it seems like a normal presentation, further we look, 1 was normal, checking the second with PDF, yes, huge slab, redo immediately, I'm sending now, I look, somehow they look very much on white background, and maybe let her make it without white, if anything, the picture so that without white, I mean the cover itself, the first frame should be, and here too, like this 2, also from this same presentation, also their 2, 3 slabs of different formats, funeral agency work, good if Stas hadn't said, honestly now this third picture I'm looking at also seems, this looks, this is from one presentation, this was all from the second, this is presentation 2, I'm looking, 3 presentations, so that already all this is done, presentation 3, clicked on gravestone, in past tense write yes and scream ri-ri-ri-ri-ri, this is like for a company, you know, a gravestone, on the second you put there simpler, you this, in short, only 2, 3 presentations suffered, so in the third presentation I don't understand why, identical, really identical frames, or on the first wedding of one presentation, on 2, and inscriptions anyway redo, to purely different sides, sides, all as if 2 and 4 frames actually change, to 2 and 3 gravestone slab take, so not sent these, not normal, this is generally we did, I'll send here video, they write video required, there the word Russia this, and in the day and plague I don't remember what we generally in Pictory made some video, I'll look of course, but you when you try, if everything, they themselves did, I think, also Kolia some period of time by default did, then in Pictory was playing around, yes actions, and presentation with cat, like here generally turn off that Russian with old cat, on repair employees, analog company style helping people and businesses 2018 great to see, and here in principle some slide, probably congratulations on, so Sviat once removed, now I remember even sent this card, there he Russia there removed, generally slides became with that work, third picture revealed grade reason from progress December yogurt on international pro jacks, so here and Johnny pictures catch institutes lavrit display front with that same, you on this not we generated, then they shoot this at summit, and regenerated here as and straight, well yes small cat some strange even not drawn, simply yes and"

"Sviat wrote: Need to redo this video, there's a slide with a map and Russia is marked there, need to... Ahh, all, I understand now. But was it really marked in principle when? We never worked with them, agree. Neither with Russia - yes. Nor with Belarus did we work. This is, of course, a question. No, the main thing, hear, really funny. You look, Belarus, the main thing, is gray on this map. I'll send you a screenshot now. And this one, what's his name: and Russia is blue? At the same time, we really never worked with them even before the military actions. This wasn't that segment. Well yes. In presentations for clients we don't have Russia and didn't have. You see this frame, and here we need to remove, it turns out, redo it too - and Sviat will come tomorrow, and we'll then work on this thing? Yes. Or can we give it to Dasha? Well better Sviat, because I don't know who did this through Pictory, what this, we won't pass, good."

### Late Afternoon - Email Newsletter Test Task Discussion
**What I worked on:**
- Discussed test assignment for new designer candidate
- Reviewed email newsletter design requirements and structure
- Explained design standards and mobile/desktop versions needed
- Prepared test task brief for American client

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
"Victoria: I made this line on two elements full width, because otherwise it shows incorrectly... So our task, we'll need to develop examples. Maybe take several examples, email newsletter. Now, for example, I'll send you, and for example, the last one, here's how it looks - There's some sample there, so- Yes, I'll send you - yes, sending now, here's the last one I did on the project, there's the link, email newsletter was. Approximately, so you understand how it looks, what blocks there are and so on. Yes, there we had just a monthly email newsletter. Here, I sent you, yes. For example, for a company that deals with, there, garbage, we have, yes it? Here's how. So, it's in principle similar to a website. There's nothing particularly important, they come in different styles and so on. This is just for example, so you understand, yes, what in newsletters there's usually a block with some social networks of this client - Katia Dreva: There's a main banner with main information, or it will be, aaa, there 'meet us', yes, 'hello, meet us', for example, there domain 'November' is written, yes? Further, for example, you make some news there, you can insert some video, you can insert. Especially since the client likes it in principle. Now insert video, so it looks like just a placeholder or any YouTube video you can find, so it displays, yes, for the client. Katiusha: And here's how it usually pulls from YouTube to email newsletter immediately with subtitles, so you don't need to develop it especially. If it's already uploaded on YouTube, then the same subtitle will display in the email newsletter. This is what I recently found, here. Yes it, of course, these newsletters come in all kinds, on... Oh, there's more in different variations, on... Here. Now, something I can't find, maybe so. Yes, for example. Old, some, yes? I, as an option, just sent another one I found. Here's something we did, yes? Yes, well here, in the project. Yes. Yes. So this is in principle any info should be there, structure - doesn't matter which. Size, in principle, usually they're also different. You can make it standard, there also different size. Seems here. There, where somewhere six hundred pixels, somewhere I had there, aaa, width one thousand four hundred, seems. Need to look at these pictures. Aaa, well so look there you can width, it's in principle standard, you can use on these examples, as I provided. Especially pay attention, when you have an email newsletter, it should be immediately both mobile version, and it should be desktop version. Yes, Nastia, welcome to us. Yes, this is him. Yes, this is him. Yes, now we'll explain, good? Test tomorrow. Cool! Yes, yes, then we'll move on so. E-e-e, in the example, as you understood, in principle, any can be. So the main thing is that it's somewhat similar to a landing page, the structure itself. You first, what you do, you make some banner, you should have a main one, yes, which we have-"

**Original (Russian/Ukrainian):**
[Original transcript from lines 93-94]

### Evening - Client Contract Discussion: Polina Project Issues
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed contract terms and client expectations for Polina's project
- Discussed timeline misunderstandings (client expected full website + presentations in one month at part-time)
- Clarified actual project scope: design + presentations only (no development)
- Addressed invoice and payment issues
- Reviewed transcript to verify what was actually agreed upon

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

**English Translation:**
"I wanted to ask you about... Alina was there the whole month on this, on datamining, did redesign, then these edits, and they still have them. Yes. She was doing all this the whole time. Well yes, supposedly, what we discussed with her. This will be both a new website, and- For half-time there at least, Bykova we definitely couldn't agree on one month. For half-time we definitely didn't agree that we would have a ready website. We couldn't even do that. Well we didn't agree like that, we just wrote what she would do. Design,- That this will be for us... Design and presentations - good, that's as an option, yes? And development of the website itself - that's no way. -yes for half-time for, for a month. Well, this simply wouldn't be realistic, well, immediately wouldn't be realistic, well. We have Bykova, she worked full-time. We don't have time to make even this one landing. I'm telling you what he wrote to me. Well, this is how I understand, there was probably Stas with you on the call, and you weren't there at all then on the call. We understood it that way. You weren't there at all. Yes, and it turns out that maybe they promised something there, but I know, I know you. You usually come to me and say, approximately how much time this will take, and we decide together and just in case we say. Well, well... I definitely know that we couldn't come to such, to such a thought with you. Who's not exactly Yes, yes. Girl: And I know that this definitely isn't done for half-time. If she had at least full-time there for a whole month, then I could, you know, think that such could be. But for half-time this is definitely no. Because we even with you purely accidentally found out this on the past week, that it turns out we, we also promised them a website. And there supposedly she said, there's no deadlines, nothing, yes. Svitlana: We didn't talk about deadlines at all. Let's start with- Dictator: Yes, yes. Svitlana: -When I was on the call, we didn't talk about deadlines. Dictator: Yes. Svitlana: We didn't say that this would be. 'We'll start from a month.' Dictator: Yes. Svitlana: But that all this would be done in a month, that wasn't and- Dictator: This is unrealistic. Svitlana: -That doesn't exist. Dictator: No freelancer would do this. Well, or a freelancer would do it, there, with overtime, there, twelve hours, there, if they would work. Well these are unrealistic tasks. Girl 1: Create both a website, and that immediately, well, well, I just know that we couldn't even offer such. Landing, well if this was, well there, but there, again, there's not a landing, there's a multi-page website, there, if there with Nastia Dobrym we there missed, there landing multi-page website, then here immediately was a task, that there was immediately a multi-page website. Girl 2: Well yes. So I don't know. Yes, hmm. Here's what Lid writes to me: 'Let me open the contract again.' I already looked at it, the day before yesterday I'm looking at it and there's no such thing there. Something like this, well here it's written: creation of a new website, placement of a new website on the network, eee, here, also teach them... We should in a month both development and presentations. Oh, this is unrealistic! Yes. Part-time employment without any additional payments. I don't know. Well... Well. I'll go to Kolia. Generally falls. Well yes. Thanks that there was again, and I wasn't there at all! Who will get it now? I understand! Oh! You yourself so she doesn't come out! And is Kolia still on interviews today? What, the whole day interviews? Damn I don't know how to catch him now. Now maybe he's... Now I'm at 12:00 under Super. Interview. And here's what's written in our contract. Yes. Didn't they tell you that this would be changed? Well, I know that even Polina herself didn't say, there, she says, there's no deadline there, and he there... Maybe he misunderstood something? Maybe send him the contract? Because there's no such thing in the contract. Maybe we agreed on this, but for PART-TIME we couldn't. We simply really couldn't offer such. Understood. -even to teach them, this is approximately at least for, well, half a day at least, yes, well, at least one day this is already minus from her contract. We have Bykova did less on the project for full-time for a month than Polina. Today What's written in our contract? Well, here everything is written, but there are no deadlines. Svyatoslav, I asked him then, he also told me that there are no deadlines. Yes. Well he needs to be pulled out, yes, pulled out on a call. Well presentations are good. The easiest option to finish a presentation, she'll finish it. Well, so there somehow. Some variations. And to make a website, this is unreal... Only another month, really, well. Otherwise I don't see options, but. OK, I see, she sent on the sixth... Sent to him. Now I'll say, something she sent a new link to the design, this is in Figma. She, in short, made... Well she made a presentation, she also sent us the same."
