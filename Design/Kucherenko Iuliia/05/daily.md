## Activities

### 11:30 - Daily Report Setup and Generation
**What I worked on:**
- Setting up daily report generation system using Cursor AI
- Configuring daily.md, plans.md, and tasks.md file structure
- Testing transcript processing and translation workflow
- Configuring Cursor to use Sonet model instead of Composer
- Setting up GitHub verification for Visual Studio Code integration

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Did you see it or not? So, Kolia yesterday evening posted in the admin report chat. He put out that we have 10 designers who didn't write reports. I wrote to Artemchuk: "What are you doing there? You gathered all the project managers. Litvinova didn't write a report and all the others." I said: "Wow! They weren't even told about this and can we somehow exempt them from this? Because they'll all turn around and leave, quit." So Kolia Artemchuk told me this is for the future, to hide folders that exist there. Actually, Vilia took third place by the way, across the whole company, he's in the leaders. Congratulations for yesterday, you took third place in the company. Now he has to dictate for a long time for each activity. Petra, I dictated for half an hour, probably. I didn't even understand it. So first place yesterday was taken by Artemchuk, second place by Viko Reconvalt, and third - Vilia. There are more places, who's 1, 2, 3. We'll get a bonus.

Right button at the top Composer Error, you'll choose at the bottom not composer but sonet. Here it's not composer but sonet, model code is sonet now. But why did we install Claude then if we're not using his model? I think sonet is enabled. Well, there you can get credits. Well, yes, you can. And if I do this, will everyone do this mass? Let's like there was an instruction with composer VPN, there's no VPN. Wait, maybe it only works through VPN? No, it should work normally. Well, let's try, and if something, then we'll try through VPN.

Here's the file which is daily, here it is daily. I inserted the transcription so it's long. Normal, yes. So I wrote, well, let's say 11:30 setup and generation of Daily plans task, well, so, high-priority will be. Recording setup for report, text went. Here it is... I'll scroll it now. Well, everything further, you've done everything, yes. Here comes the second one 12:00 based on report short instruction, well, and this is the second instruction, here it is small, everything seems yes, it's saved this file as daily.md, now from it copy-paste there, yes, now where do I go? Here? Copy-paste, yes, go, well, maybe here, you can directly, let's try in Cursor directly, here in this chat that you have open, yes, we didn't try yesterday, let's try here, yes, let's go here. And in Cursor, where do you insert this? Copy-paste this, yes, now shift enter to go to a new line. By the way, there was already this, something else, I still have it in Russian, shouldn't it be in English? I don't know, but I did it like that. In this prompt it was needed that we with Timchik made, in it needed to add that translate to English, there's a prompt in which this is written, yes? Well, let's maybe send Sviat, and send in chat generally, well, just where is this prompt located in chat, and we'll take it now honestly, no, now excuse me, will send, yes, here it is, and now, and there to inconvenient these rows with one move select. There you can already on the left select all three files and copy their addresses simultaneously, yes, yes. Well, Sviat, let's without this, here we delete, then let's try, yes. Like this? Yes, and now yes Daily Plans and Tasks, yes. Here this copy-paste, and there from the very bottom Shift Enter and paste and click. Wait, mode there they said Ask Before Edits, probably I think you can try, well, let's send correctly here, if code this was in Cursor, there was also should be this plan mode, well, here there's no such thing, yes, there is such, yes, then also and yes plan-mode exists, yes, yes. So I now just in case, screenshots, save everything, safe, yes, and command, yes, only it works, but we wait, I went, ready, and here now it gives me an error, well, but most likely I think this you know what it's connected with, was that many guys probably sat and either who got credits or glitch, well, what they say in Cursor generally in principle works even with glitches very often, even developers when they do, it works today, in two days doesn't work, this is such a thing, I don't know.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully configured Cursor AI for daily report generation
- Set up file structure for daily.md, plans.md, and tasks.md
- Encountered verification issues with Visual Studio Code that were resolved
- Identified need for English translation of transcripts

### 12:00 - Team Discussion: Admin Reports and Statistics
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewing admin report statistics posted by Kolia
- Discussing report requirements and quality standards
- Addressing concerns about project managers being included in designer reports
- Reviewing department rankings and individual performance metrics

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

So it turns out that Kolia every day, I understand, this will happen. He conducts statistics for each employee separately. If you look there in the chat, admin reports, where Kolia sits, a bit higher, yes? Admin getline and there admin reports wrote directly for each employee, what and how. There, that Ponomariova generally doesn't write anything. She has empty files on Dropbox, and directly for each. We have, besides that - that we also added all project managers to designers. I wrote to Artemchuk yesterday: "Artemchuk, what is this at all?" Yes. He told me: "You can not worry, I'll talk with Kolia, everything will be okay." And at this stage, I understand, the most important thing is that it exists. What quality it will be, that's not crucial anymore. But the most important thing is that it exists. And there whoever knows how, whoever, like, file weighs the most, that one, like, wins. Well, accordingly, I think, yes. I think, accordingly, most realistically will weigh the file is Kolia Artemchuk's and Niko Karr's. Because they constantly go on calls, and they communicate, communicate, communicate... How else can they evaluate it? I don't know. Besides counting kilobytes? They, they all, all reports for the day they... extract, so that personally this... They, they with reason and... I don't know. Well, let's try, as is, what there. Well, I'm saying, at this stage... Artificial intelligence wrote about my children, that they... Everything. Artificial intelligence considers that they are understandable. If Nikokarr doesn't understand anything there, then what comes out of this? That is, about, about, about reports? Artificial intelligence about reports for now understandable children? Well, like yes. Well, most important... How, how else can they respond? Well, most important for now, like, just write at least. Well. Yes.

**Outcomes:**
- Clarified that quality standards are relaxed for now, priority is on having reports submitted
- Understanding that file size/weight may determine rankings
- Confirmed need to write reports daily regardless of content quality
- Identified need to check admin reports chat regularly for individual feedback

---

### 13:00 - Video Editing: Storyboard Project Discussion
**What I worked on:**
- Discussing urgent storyboard video project
- Reviewing Dasha's previous video work and feedback
- Addressing issues with AI content generation (restrictions on children/minors)
- Planning next steps for video interview projects

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Dasha Karsova, if you came in, yes? Tell me, there yesterday you had some video for Story Board? Yesterday too, of course! Well, in short, it came out there, well, in... It worked out, but it worked out like not very well, because well, like, well, quality-wise everything is normal, but in terms of... I made a video, here this, like I said, there a girl then sent to herself a queen la-la-la, then I look and there and here it comes to me that in this program they only have pets and kids, and I understand that there probably they don't make portraits. No-no-no, Marta said they do everything, doesn't matter there, like, they even film funerals and do it like that, well, if so then yes, okay, just I look, I understand that this is nonsense, like, it doesn't suit like that, well, well, okay, now I like quickly redo, like replace her in the picture the queen, replace her with a little girl, and like she in the end gives it to her grandmother, well, like for memory, I don't know. Neural networks refused to generate me an infant. And I yesterday probably saw, I came in, yes, this is not allowed there, this is prohibited content, infants and the like. True, for pedophiles to generate. Yes, yes, yes, this is how they massage everything, this is all taboo.

Video interviews are in priority, and further we'll already look at requests from the customer, what he writes, yes, as an option. And just what for me then today in the second half, I thought this is video interviews, I thought you'll have enough two today for the head, if what, I think Nastia will come in, yes, I'll ask her probably, like this, he has them for 2 hours today on call, and as an option, can she say like today you continue or enough, because we worked on him like, well, beyond the norm, free, two weeks free, that is, such a thing, yes. Now like, like, more our tasks are in priority with video interviews, yes, to unload, and don't forget here, yes, and don't forget to write these reports, everything. I had yesterday a block, it generally didn't work, everything works normally, from report already, from report need to insert not only which, not only dictate to him all transcripts of calls, hope, well, here I'm now writing Whisper, well, outcome I don't know, this is from myself to write, what from today's call I understood that I need to do, well, yes, create step 2 video interviews, list such and such a person, such and such a profession, and so on and so on.

**Outcomes:**
- Identified challenges with AI content generation restrictions
- Confirmed video interviews as priority task
- Need to continue working on video interview projects
- Important to include call transcripts in daily reports

### 14:00 - Honey Stone Project: Design to Development Handoff Discussion
**What I worked on:**
- Discussing file format requirements for Honey Stone project
- Addressing mismatch between Figma design files and development needs
- Reviewing project scope: landing page redesign evolved into multi-page platform
- Clarifying project requirements: static vs. editable content, multi-language support
- Discussing timeline constraints and feasibility

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Rabbit: This was. Ah, for today you have a project there, yes? Tell me, please, when you generally started working, then I, here I was asking, is something normal in Figma working or not? Was there any discussion of that, in what format you should transfer files for further development or not? You generally nobody told you anything about this. Tetyana Kulpak: No, there wasn't. Rabbit: There wasn't, that is, actually. Because now we were told that, like, Olya said, that files... Wild, e-e-e, you made this - this is that task, to pull it onto hosting. I understand, yes, they don't fit. Yes, I think, you need, probably, now also Olya to call. Yes, yes. In what sense don't they fit? Here I wanted to ask. She said that it doesn't fit them. Well, oh, well... Now. What's your project called? Honey Stone. Now we'll decide, because I think, here also something, how it needs to be. Because first of all need to deal with then the project, tasks, and then everything else. You're today on us ten hours, yes, working? Yes. Yes, everything then. With grandmother how, normal, everything? Oh, well, how to say? Not very. Bad. Yes. Well, if there will be needed there, weekends half a day, there, still somehow there, well, write, yes, what... Good. The only thing, well, there, you can, there, for example, on, there, for two hours, there, so that in one day everything you worked, need this way. Well, well, and what with her generally? Woman's voice 2: She had a stroke. Narrator: Ah, well, that's how it is. Well, well, and they took her out now or not? That is, there the most important thing is when how quickly help is given. Woman's voice 2: Well yes, but she's still not very good. She almost doesn't speak, doesn't walk. Narrator: This is a normal situation after a stroke. There already then they develop. How old? Do you know how many? Eighty-four. This I remember, and this, with stroke there is such, e-e, such medicines are, "Octavigen", as I now remember. Here, so that all, all, how many told me, that this is best, they, there, well, expensive cost, but they, there, on brain well influence, and-and, e-e, there how with strokes... In reanimations they take them people and so on. Yes, and there with stroke it's the brain that's most important, that suffers, yes. Because of this everything else is lost, yes, well, like movements and so on, yes. If, for example, you'll still partially on project work, then can as an option, you can and for some time transfer, if needed will be, there, to evening shifts, for example, there, from third to twelfth, if convenient will be. Well everything, then, then normal, then we work as is. Yes. This way. Well... That is for now, and can you, maybe, while we're waiting there, maybe show us the files, which there are, which you made, tell, in what format. So that more or less understand, what there might not be right, yes. Good. Well, I worked like in Figma, and all files I have in Figma. I just threw a link to - Figma. -exactly, e, Figma and everything. Well, now, m-m, I'll open - m-m, I'll open Figma. Ah, let's. We wait like this.

So, how do we simply need to make, there, well, layout. I know that we transferred this in website design, and Moskalenko did layout once, I remember, yes. But it took, as much as I remember, a long time. How do we simply get out of this? We actually need to satisfy the needs of this client. And here what for us... Yes. What, what? Well, you what? We have... Stas was satisfied after all this. Even not that satisfied, he also must receive until the 15th hour wagon. Here it is, some form, filling, yes? Where should it be saved, I'm embarrassed to ask? Well this, and not only that, I understand, here also a problem in that need also and to customers all this agree, right, Olya? Well, first of all, to customers. Well you understand, well, everything. Can get rich. Yes, so that designers all this... tell. What are these cards? Where do they come from? Designers now tell. Okay. I also understand that yes. And at least from the other side Olya... And who is this player from gray squares? What should be there? Some kind of domovik. What domovik? Yes. Well generally... I have a bit global question. This should be where the site generally? For one time or it will constantly be his... And here let the designer now better answer this question. Nastia, let's! This, well, this is first of all what need to ask. Let's maybe she will, yes, maybe she will completely at least a bit tell, and then we'll ask her questions already after. Olya translates as an option or as Nastia will be convenient or herself translates, yes. Let's, yes, and you'll tell there briefly simply for what, how, because we are zero in this project, we know nothing, yes. So you see the screen? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, and we start directly from the first screen, for what, how, with all details.

It's a landing site, it's like multi-page, and well, here there are several additional pages, that is. Let's first tell what it does, I'll interrupt you. Tell first what the company does. What was the request from the client, that is, what needed to be done, landing or multi-page site, single-page, and so on and so on, maybe on what it should work, that is, generally what the client wanted, some request from the client. The client wanted a redesign of the existing site, that is, well, the client had a landing and he wanted its redesign. Ah, by the way, I remember we even did, Olya, we here did for him like a test task, version, so worked out, this was in Lobobol, still in some, so worked out, I see that you still reworked this, yes, as an option, everything, I remembered, yes, we did in AI like a landing redesign, and this was a test, yes, and he not, I understand, there didn't take with such, that on him more took. So, well, what does the company generally do, tell? The company deals with like supply of technical component devices, there also conducts trainings. Ee, and for what do you generally supply products? Yes. E-e, well... E-m-m, too... clients, which there, for example, are owners of laboratories. Aha, everything, understood now. Aha. Yes. See, I generally know nothing about this project. That's why I ask, so more or less understand. Yes, yes.

So, who went further? And so, he wanted a landing or multi-page site? Well, he wanted a landing. As I said, he wanted exactly a landing redesign, that is... Mm. And tell, as Lilia said, this landing should be - Yes. This landing should be, there, for some time? Or should it be permanent? Its own. Specifically wanted to go, yes, but main, so that now it already is before his, this, conference. Now. Yes. He wanted to present, but so that it further exists and like works. That is, long-term, what Lilia asked. So let's further then continue. Well, this is the main page.

So, the problem is that the client... Don't shoot me. Yes, the client wants, so that he himself edits these photos and so on. For that, so that he himself edits, need to know for developers, like what platform he knows, or this need to develop on WordPress, or this need can write ourselves and then teach him to change this. An option like this, because he said, that he wants himself also pictures to change. And text. They talked about exchange, but where it will be, we didn't talk, didn't clarify. Not only that, he also has a Chinese version of the site should be. For American and Chinese market. I told everyone about this, I don't know, a hundred and fifty times. Well and... This is not a landing. Yes, yes, yes. Here just a question arose. Here by this approach it already... I just talked with Olya, with Stas. He asked a hundred times. There just this already came out not a landing, but a multi-page site. And there each page need separately develop. Well really, as Stas said - Here it's not even multi-page, here it's a whole platform. Yes. With frontend, with backend, and also with admin panel for changing it... This Stas said like this, this is not one-two done. Or here needed to immediately really launch, so that already this base was preparing, I on that... I don't know. Well! We already agreed on a landing. You see, and it came out like this. Well, this is not a landing. Yes. Here it comes out like this, that this is much more than a landing. This is not a landing. Yes, this is much more. Landing is one page, and here page main, page form, page, some of these, still six pieces of something. This is first. Second, well, okay, language changes in landing - Yes, still can be, but content changes. Well, landing is some encoded information - And it became unchangeable. In code, and not that a person can edit it. That is, actually landing she developed this first page, first page she made and everything, landing ended on this. And she here has a lot of everything. She made directly really a whole platform. Nastia, well done! Yes, in this sense we overdid. Just the client incorrectly set the task. It comes out, with his wants it came out, that he wanted a landing, and we did what he wanted. But now we have time constraints. I understand like this. Well, look, what I have written separately in the contract, by points. So like this. Project "Redesign migration of website", obligations, our obligations: design UX/UI and information architecture. Structure. Adaptive layouts for computer, tablet, blah-blah-blah. Made. Mobile devices. There, made. Next. Possibility of admin panel to add, delete PDF files, video projects. This like Olya-la. Brand elements, access credentials and modern approaches in approval. That is, he wants himself all this to edit, what he wrote. If migration, that is, it means as much as I understood, it means that he at least will give all files and everything, that he now has access. Yes, he this yes. But this actually nonsense, as I understand, this all exists like this. A-a-a... Again this, it and done. No, this is completely different. On it need separately look. What's nonsense here? Ah, yes? That, that there you took, extracted, inserted text. And for us where this, now this text to insert, if he wants it still to edit? And is there a link, give a link to the old site, please. Well at least yes, yes. We're talking about design. Well, what does it mean? Maybe there already is some there brand? Well, maybe... Well, if he at least something exists. If there is at least some logic of sending, and need simply update front, then questions no. Okay, and if this to do from scratch everything in the world? Well yes, very much. Look, yes. Sent, what will you say? Yes, there! In principle, he now like a landing, not like, but a landing. Well, this is not a landing, Nastia. This, well, when, there landing - this is when one page without transition, only up-down can on landing ride. And here we have transition separate. No, this is a landing. Landing? This is a landing. Ah, well this was, you mean? Now... Well yes, was, was. Ah, was, yes. And now became, I mean, not a landing. Understood. And so same he here on site can transition to these, who are these his partners? This what, Nastia showed on some slide, when I was here with you ten minutes ago. This is PTE. Exactly at the beginning were these pages and from the very beginning could transition to partners. Well yes, yes. Oksana: It's there at the end of the site, look. This is not one landing, this is landings, like this let's say. Well yes, separate only eight pieces comes out. Sergei: Well, like they say, that on Tilda. Oksana: Yes, I also see this, this generally well... Well, Chinese market. Well, means on Tilda need to do, right? Well, I think so. I think so. On Tilda we won't make this. On Tilda there are ready components, which you simply like a constructor assemble and comes out this such a hat. Generally none, no customization there is. This is a constructor, which you insert and there maximum at paid, at paid subscription you can change colors. Everything. Oksana Shulga: And this is not even WordPress. Iryna Shatalova: This actually you need from scratch, yes, everything to do? Oksana Shulga: Well, of course, simply question, and this site could he somehow edit? I understand, on Tilda, maybe, he and could. Leonid Siyi: And there are transitions by cards? Oksana Shulga: Couldn't edit here edit? Ah, well, I don't know. It seems to me, that no. This need to know. In principle, if he wanted a redesign, then maybe and couldn't really. This actually, probably, this was a template. I think so, this was. I have one question. Here is - e-e, this is new like task, that on Chinese market? Or does he have possibility to switch? I simply don't see, maybe, there - I also don't see. He doesn't have possibility. Of course, doesn't have this. This he wanted simply. Edit, switch, save. This actually he need simply new site to make. Yes. A lot. This is not that new site, this is also with admin panel - Yes. -completely different things. To make... Yes. Simply. Well, how quickly? Like in two days, as Stas said, generally. I felt, that something there is not right. The more Nastia tells, what need to do, especially also translation of content, which he will change to another language. This is completely, damn. Nastia, probably, next time, where... How many there? There base directly... I told her, that this is not for one-two days, but that this is so long, that this still has to be still before that layout, still some stage. This is not in queue. Well, if you know, if landing, as he said, one at least to make, then easier would be like this. And here really this whole thing. Here problem is that there some backend, base, I understand, some. This need to play with this. Yes, I understand this. Well simply... How many pages can you do there conditionally until the fifteenth? What pages? Show me now on Figma. Let's here simply tell completely, not pages there actually is one page. Only here problem is that... How is this? In backend... Backend... Is that need to think through logic this whole with transitions and forms and so on and so on in this. Let's maybe you'll say what can really be done? You can make this landing Honey Stone, here this all with blocks. Right? Let's like this, we can make this design that he confirmed. But it will be only like this and non-changing. Yes, blocks he won't be able to change, neither text, nor picture, nothing. Maximum 4 blocks. Maximum, yes, and small clarifications, who writes, I hope, yes Whisper? And question about form, where does he want it saved? That is, if we make a form... Or we make for now without form, if simply question, where to him, how to him, what to him... Yes. That is, for example, like we have on site, this "Remote Helpers", someone booked a call and it comes, where to you, to email comes, what where to you it comes? Result. Here need to know - Yes, to email. -where it comes and where you to client this need, so that it comes, there! Okay, so like this. Nastia made a whole structure. We can make only like this, so that it doesn't change. We can, but like this, so that it changes for now won't be and will be without form. And plus, can we translate it to Chinese for this period? I understand, that no. Well, no. Look, we can to AI give context, translate to Chinese. Correctness of translation we don't guarantee. I understood. Understood, so that he... That is, so that he gave, for example, Chinese files. Well, can, but need to give translation to Chinese of all content. That is, in principle... Yes. That is, translation of landing to make we can, but it all will be unchangeable. That is, he what, only, if he wants to receive, so that everything was beautiful, so that it could switch, admin panel and so on and so on. This means he need still to buy still one month with developer. Olya, well, how do you think, how much will this cost? Or here like everything. Well, I'll say like this. What will you say? Well, yes, offhand, I don't know. Month, two, there. For a month, okay. Yes, we'll make. No question. This if what, question to Olya.

So, last day comes out for us, yes. Fourteenth - last day, when we all must hand over. A-a-a, on Monday, well, like, he said something. Well, this is left a week, and today can count. Thursday, Friday - seven days. Yes. Well and how to explain, - yes, - so that for Kolia girls I meant, so that easier would be. How much, for example, time really will take this process, to make, because we really too, well, generally even imagine can't, e-e, how much time will take this process, to fulfill this point about editing materials. Well, from and to. Let's like this. Well, at least approximately.

Well okay, I'll write to him today, maybe come out his today call on call. Nastia, you said, he there somewhere went, yes, to conference or how? What he said, that his not to disturb until Friday, yes? You know, if honestly, I don't think, that his can call on call, because, e-e, yes, here he went on order, as I understood, until Friday, and-and I even wrote to him yesterday, simply wrote in WhatsApp, asked about icons, he still hasn't answered.

**Outcomes:**
- Identified major scope discrepancy: project evolved from simple landing to multi-page platform with admin panel
- Confirmed design work is complete (UX/UI, adaptive layouts)
- Determined that static layout can be done in 5-6 days, but editable content requires backend development (1-2 months)
- Need to clarify form submission requirements with client
- Chinese translation possible but not guaranteed for quality
- Client unavailable until Friday, need to schedule call for requirements clarification

### 15:00 - Video Editing Tools Discussion
**What I worked on:**
- Discussing CapCut version (free vs. Pro)
- Comparing CapCut with Loom for screen recording
- Reviewing video editing capabilities and limitations
- Planning video interview project work

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Dasha, I wanted to ask. What version of CapCut do you have? Yes? Pro or not? No-no, no, not pro. I don't have pro, but at the moment I'm working with many cool features. Aaa. Well, probably there it somehow happens, I'm saying, here this, then itself updates, then itself buries, and well, there only, well, some nonsense, well, for now, well, only awesome these transitions, all sorts, effects, and everything such cool. And I would like to ask, to post site on host, I sent to Olya Nastia's Figma, but it doesn't fit. What need to do? In sense doesn't fit? Olya said, that it doesn't fit? Yes, like, that it's only drawn. Or this for me better take Nastia and go to Olya with question? Stas, I think, yes. But, damn, well, this was needed to say, how they needed files to do. There, this is for you now... And sorry? This should have already Stas done. And it came out like this, that now not Stas does, but Olya, yes. Well yes, I don't know where Stas. He, like, in Bali is. No, well, I know - You, decided with Kolia, that need to go to Olya. Well, need so, yes, but simply this was needed, you know, how - There, generally, at the beginning, in principle, simply Nastia asked me, is it normal, that I make set in Figma. Well, I said, well, design she makes, I didn't know, that it even on hosting need will be to dump. Well, normal. In principle, any designer works in Figma. And there client, especially, many edits gave, and so on, and she made it in Figma. And Olya now, I understand, rather all, will need code. Some HTML, CSS. Well, it can be extracted, in principle, from Figma. Yes, need to search plugins. But there, well, was needed simply, e-e, first of all to discuss format, in which needed, was needed, so that designer transferred to developer this site. Because I understand, there you know how, there when earlier we, here for example, did layouts, then next step for us was in this, to make, e-e, layout. Here we had there Moskalenko. Maybe remember, I don't know, Oleksandr was, dealt with. Here, he did, I know. Yes, did layout this site, and only then, when it was, this with - it was laid out and only then it was pulled onto this hosting. But now there, I again don't know, how it there is difficult, this most important - this work exactly to do, to pull onto hosting this option. And I even don't know, really, need with this to speed up, probably. And will need, probably, really together sit. Olya with Nastia, so that Nastia like simply prepared then files as needed for client. Just then, if such variation, then Nastia on us work won't, then she actually on client continues to work. Yes, if there she will need much time with files to add. I think, best way is like this, Nastia. Well, good. Yes, still I have a question. Yes, Nastia, Marta me, I don't know, wrote, she you yesterday sent message from site - Yes, yes, I know, yesterday talked about Simas. Yes, and simply he there, well, there not directly so aggressively wrote, he simply asked, like, will be, won't be. Well, he simply asked, what next, what she will do next. Yes, simply she got nervous, that like, you know, that maybe still complaint, or something like this. Yes, in principle, there nothing such he, directly, nothing said. She'll do and everything. Today comes out also. She yesterday worked and today she has so same comes out, like this, last day like on this week. On right. Yes. That's why like this. Let her continue, if there something. She simply like wrote, so that I have complaints not and wrote - wrote, that send Nastia immediately, not only me, so that Nastia also in course was. Yes. About this site-buno, well. Well, this is yes, yes. He simply asked, like, what you - Yes, yes. What she will do next, what will be next like steps. She understood this like as complaint - Yes, yes. Like wrote: "Well, you saw, - Well yes, well yes. -that I work already two hours on today, I already everything!" Yes, yes, yes, and she there on two hours, and she, e-e, and actually she now on him four, on five even works. There. And now. Well, like also yes. That's why... Need simply write, what she will do, what will be next steps further. Yes, she said: "I returned with you", because I think, - This is more logical. Yes, yes, well, misunderstanding, yes, such... This like me yesterday also on project sent. A-a, there I sat, think, here this. Couldn't understand. There me said: "Transfer, please, to company, which deals with garbage removal, that it doesn't deal with..."
