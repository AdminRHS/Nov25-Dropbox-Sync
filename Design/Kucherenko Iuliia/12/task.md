### Instructions:

**Purpose and Context:**
The company is building a modern AI-powered knowledge library to replace outdated task libraries. By transcribing YouTube tutorials about design tools and AI automation, we extract structured information (Actions, Objects, Tools, Use Cases, step-by-step tasks) that AI can understand and use to generate better task instructions for the team.

**System Instructions (Prompt v4):**
This file tells Google AI Studio how to process videos. It instructs the AI to:
- Identify potential tasks and action sequences
- Extract keywords and tool names
- List capabilities and use cases
- Create step-by-step task breakdowns
- Organize information in a structured format

**Video Selection Criteria:**
- **Tools:** Eleven Labs, Gamma, Cursor, Midjourney, Figma, Adobe Firefly, AI design tools, automation tools
- **Topics:** Design automation, AI workflows, tool integrations, productivity hacks, tutorial content
- **Recency:** Max 1-2 months old (tools update frequently, need current information)
- **Length:** Start with 10-20 minutes (manageable processing, good detail level)
- **Quality:** Clear instruction, step-by-step format, reputable creator

**Technical Challenges and Solutions:**

**Token Limits:**
- Free Google AI Studio: 4K tokens used per request, 32K max
- Longer videos consume more tokens
- Solution: Request paid accounts for heavy users, rotate free accounts, prioritize shorter videos

**System Instructions Placement:**
- In Google AI Studio, look for "System Instructions" or "Custom Instructions" field
- Usually in settings or at top of new prompt/chat
- Paste entire Prompt v4 content there before adding video link

**Output Quality:**
- First attempts may have learning curve
- Review output critically - is information useful?
- Adjust System Instructions if needed for better results
- Share successful prompts with team

**Collaboration:**
This is a distributed task - multiple people working in parallel. To avoid duplicates:
- Check video index before starting new transcription
- Update index immediately after completing video
- Communicate in Discord/team channel about videos in progress

**Long-term Vision:**
Building this library enables:
- Better AI task generation for design team
- Modern tool knowledge base
- Self-service learning resources
- Innovation and continuous learning culture

### Resources and Links:
- Iryna's Figma design files (request current link)
- Design system documentation
- Department mascot requirements
- Brand guidelines (color palettes, typography, etc.)
- Reference images for bird species variety
- Animation capability documentation


### Instructions:

**Homepage Variants:**
Iryna has created several homepage design options. Review process should be:
- Look at each variant holistically first
- Evaluate against goals: clarity, engagement, brand representation
- Provide specific, actionable feedback (not just "looks good" or "I don't like it")
- Consider user journey and calls-to-action
- Think about mobile responsiveness

**Card Design and Animation:**
Cards are likely key UI components (developer cards, service cards, etc.). Important considerations:
- Animation should enhance understanding, not just add motion
- "Aggression level" likely refers to animation intensity/speed
- Subtle animations often more professional than dramatic ones
- Test across devices (some animations lag on mobile)
- Consider accessibility (motion sensitivity)

**Navigation Button Sizing:**
Current concern is buttons might be too large. Balance considerations:
- Prominence (important CTAs should stand out)
- Visual balance (don't overwhelm other elements)
- Usability (too small = hard to click, especially mobile)
- Design trends (current trend toward larger, clearer buttons)
- Accessibility standards (minimum touch target sizes)

**Tool Icons:**
These likely represent software/tools the team uses (Figma, Adobe, AI tools, etc.). Review for:
- Instant recognizability (can user identify tool at glance?)
- Consistency in style, size, level of detail
- Licensing (if using third-party icons)
- Scalability (work at all sizes needed)

**Mascot Expansion Requirements:**
**Context:** Each department has bird mascots. Graphic designers department needs 10-20 options. Requirements:
- **Distinct species:** Each bird must be clearly different (not variations of same species)
- **Female gender:** All mascots should present as female
- **Purple elements:** Design department color must be incorporated
- **Recognizable:** Instant identification of species
- **Personality:** Each should have character, not just technical accuracy

**Inspiration for bird variety:**
Consider diverse species: hummingbird, owl, flamingo, parrot, eagle, swan, penguin, cardinal, blue jay, finch, robin, crane, pelican, puffin, kingfisher, woodpecker, cockatoo, macaw, etc. Mix of sizes, colors, habitats for maximum variety.

**Full-Body Designs:**
Needed for animation potential. Design considerations:
- Consistent style with existing head/bust mascots
- Neutral pose that allows rigging for animation
- All body parts clearly defined
- Maintain proportions across all mascots
- Consider different poses for different mascots (sitting, standing, flying, etc.)

**Documentation:**
Once designs approved, create comprehensive documentation:
- Design system page with all mascots
- Usage guidelines (when to use which mascot)
- File format specifications (SVG, PNG, etc.)
- Color codes and specifications
- Do's and don'ts for mascot usage
- Quick reference sheet for team

**Timeline:**
Design system work is tagged as "this week" priority. Balance quality with urgency:
- Homepage variants: Can review immediately
- Current mascot feedback: Quick turnaround
- 10-20 new mascots: Reasonable timeline (not rush), suggest 1-2 weeks
- Full-body designs: Can phase after initial designs approved

**Integration with Black Friday Campaign:**
Since Black Friday campaign needs mascots, coordinate timing:
- Ensure approved mascots available for campaign design
- Provide files in formats needed for social media
- Brief campaign designers on mascot usage guidelines
