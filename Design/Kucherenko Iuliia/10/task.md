1. Contact Maria to confirm current power status and cafe research progress
2. Review list of cafes with generators and wifi in her neighborhood (left bank Dnipropetrovsk)
3. Have Maria test working from closest cafe today - verify:
   - Laptop charging availability
   - Wifi stability and speed
   - Noise levels with headphones for client calls
   - Comfort for 2-4 hour work sessions
4. If cafes are not viable, revisit coworking space option
5. Calculate cost-benefit: 4,500 UAH/month vs. potential client revenue
6. Make decision before end of day
7. If coworking approved, coordinate with accounting for payment setup
8. Ensure Maria has Teams mobile app installed as backup communication


### Resources and Links:
- Coworking pricing: 4,500-4,800 UAH/month (~$120 USD)
- Power bank option: Special 9V/12W cables (~100 UAH each, need 2)
- EcoFlow/power station: 15,000 UAH (~$400 USD) - provides 2-3 hours
- Battery runtime: ~2 hours on Windows laptop with design software


### Instructions:

**For Maria:**
- Today: Test at least 2 cafes in your neighborhood
- Document: Name, location, wifi speed, availability of power outlets, noise level
- Before tomorrow's client review, confirm you have reliable working location
- Install Teams mobile as backup communication method

**For Management:**
