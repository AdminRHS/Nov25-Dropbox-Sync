**Whisper Flow Transcript (Translated):**

**Topic: New Developers & Power Outage Issues**

So today two new people started. Yes, two new developers started. And there I'm trying to reach Nastya with LZOV. Masha Glushko wrote to me that she won't have electricity until 14:30 and she's asking if she could work at night to kind of make up for it, if that could be arranged. And it's like, it's possible, but there's the client issue, and that's the problem. If it's okay with the client, then yes. I just think Nastya needs to be informed, or what? I just understand that this isn't a one-time thing. I looked - she lives in Dnipropetrovsk, and that's the situation there. Well, Dnipropetrovsk-Kamenskaya, this is definitely not a one-time thing, this will be stable like this. So, would it be possible to warn the client about this electricity situation? Well, no, but I understand Nastya is busy right now.

**Topic: Natasha & Iris Client Communication Issues**

We sorted things out with Natasha on Friday. I called her, basically I worked through Telegram, so to speak. Right around 13:10 I finished dealing with all of this. So it turned out that for Iris, in Irish time, Natasha should work from 10 to 14:00. And Natasha said that every time she only works four hours and not more, she starts getting complaints like "why do you work so little?" And it got to the point where now Natasha will write every morning. Basically, Iris is saying that Natasha isn't really working for her. This is all because I think we didn't sell her those subscribers she wanted. And now Natasha's task will be to report - unsubscribe at the beginning of the day "hello, I'm here" and at the end of the day "hello, I'm leaving." Because Iris wrote to her, it turned out she asked her at 12:00 "Natasha, are you here?" Natasha really answered her in three minutes "yes, I'm here." She was silent and then three hours later she sent her a message like "write me a report," but three hours later Natasha's time had already ended. That's why it's like this.

**Topic: Adobe Firefly Subscription Decision**

And another question - Kolya said on Friday, basically announced that we should buy Adobe Firefly, this subscription. I wrote to accounting to buy it on the admin account so everyone would have it immediately. The question is, they're now asking me what to buy - should we buy the Pro version or not? He has it on mini, you don't have it, you have this paid one, you have it there. And this one, ideally, it's on Natasha's account, so we can't really touch it. I asked basically for admin. The question is, how is it? That is, you use the paid one together with Natasha's account, that's why you have it, and the guys also have it, yes. So I asked for everyone to definitely log in on admin so all subscriptions would be on admin. And I say then buy for us on admin.

There's this thing. I'll throw it in the chat now - they're asking whether to buy Pro or not Pro. This morning I studied different packages that are here. The thing is that basically there, Pro doesn't really differ much from the regular one. The only thing is, I think in Pro you get Mobile App and Web Photoshop as a bonus, which might be useful to someone, you know? We could buy Pro.

So here's the thing - it generates videos, Adobe Firefly. And on the standard package for $12, this will cost basically only 20 5-second videos you can make. And on the Pro package - 40 videos. But with 20 videos we won't be able to try anything at all. With 40 there's at least a chance. So I think we're probably buying Pro - there it's like 2000 credits and 4000, but price-wise it works out the same, just twice as expensive. I'll ask for Pro then so it's there, to try it independently.

And how does it work then - right in the browser? This is a browser version. I looked this morning - browser version, yes. You just log in through admin and generate right inside there. Well, it says it includes Photoshop but you don't really have to use Photoshop. So it'll be a plus. Whatever. We don't really need 20 videos to look at. The main thing is to make drafts for presentations.

The joke is that this thing is really expensive. I looked now, today I went into the credits - damn, where did I go. So here, I went from my account to look. So yes, it takes 5 points for generating just a picture. It gives 4000 points. Yes, for image generation it gives five points. And for generation - I looked at this background, generative extension - it takes 10 points. So I basically looked - only 200 pictures can be made on the minimum package. Generative fill - that's 10 points for each generative action. But we can, but basically we're buying Pro for sure. I wrote to everyone. If there will be or won't be a subscription for this, I'm doing it.

**Topic: Maria's Power Outage Solutions Discussion**

Katya. Yes, yes. I saw my message about Maria. Yes. Listen, write - I'll see. So that she with the client, the client of the court, because it seems to me now he'll start: "I'm not going to pay for this, for that, etc." Well, but can't we warn him? For example, how did she work without power before? Well, she had it there, well it was dark. This is really terrible now. Over the weekend it was terrible, so now the whole eastern part there is terrible. They wrote that Svyat wrote to me that they also increased, ah, they increased the shutoffs. Now there won't be electricity for sixteen hours at all. Wow, terrible! Well. Well, I haven't been there - So there are no backup plans, roads and so on. Hello. Or for them there, if the power goes out, it's the same with them or without them.

Let's ask Simona now, I'll ask her to join. Hi! Can you join us? Well, it's just that when they turn off my power, I have these special cables for the power bank and for the router. My internet works as usual. Well maybe she, you know, like, maybe at least somewhere, there, laptop, there, for two hours, maybe it will last, until there won't be... Maybe such an option? Yes. Maybe there on calls, well, on calls they still need to show everything from the laptop. Yes. And design programs they are, well, convenient and the graphics card... Well yes. With charging the graphics card. Yes. And Figma especially. They all... On, Figma. It works. She already has a ribbon, but...

Tatiana, I wrote. Tell us something like that. It's already morning. Well yes, on, everyone's morning starts at different times. For someone eight o'clock is already afternoon, and for someone it's only morning, early morning. I just dragged because her headphones are off. Now, I wrote to her.

Sophia Tereshchenko: I wrote to Natasha that she started working with this, with... What's his name? Electrician. Sophia Tereshchenko: Mark 10-BJ, because he's not signing the contract for us or something.

Speaker: Aha, okay I'll ask her, yes. Maria just answered. Maria, tell me please, how are you doing with all these things, with electricity, I mean? Do you have it now or how?

Maria: There isn't any now. Yes.

Speaker: Yes, but you're still working now, right?

Katya: Well, I can last about two hours without power, but, well, for now they're promising very harsh shutoffs. Some write that it might be even sixteen hours.

Lidia Sivakova: Uh-huh.

Anastasia Demchenko: Yes, we just probably need to do something, yes. And you don't have anything at all, no EcoFlow, nothing like that, right? Power banks that could work from something.

Katya: Uh-huh.

Moderator: Can, if... these. Coworking spaces, that's it! I remembered the word. Yes, coworking. I remembered the word. Yes, well. Are there any coworking spaces? We don't have that. There aren't any at all? Just, well yes, maybe there, you could find out prices as an option, there, what, how? Yes.

So, and you on lap-, you work on a laptop, right? Yes. Yes. And you have there, uh, the battery, if something it's there for you... Can you there, for example, if you have a second battery, replace it as an option? Just can't replace the part there. No, well I mean... I thought... Yes. How? I wanted to buy a charging station specifically, but I can't yet.

And does anyone know how long a charging station lasts... Well, depends on which one? Yes, there are different ones. Well, I had one from an acquaintance who charges a full computer through it, so it lasts about two-three hours approximately.

Two-three hours. Aha. And how much does it cost? Fifteen thousand. That's a lot. Such an option. And in a cafe, if you work there? That is, well, there is, in principle, a chance at least on calls, for example, with the client-contractor, so there are calls, right?

Well, I, I'll look. Maryana Ro: We just have a small neighborhood here, and it's quite far for me to travel to the city center. So I need to walk around here, because usually our whole left bank gets shut off at once. And when I don't have power-

**Topic: Maria's Work Schedule & Power Outage Contingency Planning**

Uh-huh. So you worked on the client? Yes, I think. As an option, nothing, maybe then- Yes, possible. Yes. Just there you have- Well, that is, if I know the whole call schedule from the very morning, then I can economize. As an option, can even earlier- I think- As an option, can even start earlier, maybe. You know, like you have, for example, if there at eight, maybe start at seven, at least work an hour like that? That is, before this, before the call then, maybe you know, I don't know. That is, the most important thing for you is that your laptop works or even go to a cafe at the time when you have a call. Do you have calls every day or every other day? For now every other day. For now every other day calls. Well as an option, in principle, maybe we'll survive, so to speak.

And your calls, what time do you have them? Usually at what time? Uh, usually they were in the morning somewhere at ten-eleven. One time it was at three. Uh-huh, well, so usually they warn you properly in advance? Uh, sometimes no. Sometimes just today there will be a call and that's it, at such and such a time, well. Well yes-yes, but usually it's...

Tetyana Levchenko: There they warned a day in advance.

Kateryna Legostay: I just thought, if the battery, the battery just costs less for the laptop, if it can- can it be removed. Only why could it be, for example, to buy a battery and so you could work another two hours on the laptop under such conditions.

Lilya: And today when do you have calls?

Tetyana Levchenko: Today I look at the schedule there aren't any. Nobody wrote me about anything, so...

Lilya: Well let's try today then. If something you see a call you can join there the main thing is that the client doesn't suspect anything at all. We'll allow you to work it off. I think the client doesn't care in principle, right? The main thing for him is that you show completed work tomorrow, right?

Tetyana: Well although project managers they can, you know, answer from the phone as an option, right?

Well yes. There you can say I'm here, I'm working, etc. Yes. Uh, yes, client-- and yes, in this way. And do you have a schedule that's kept at your time at all? Like, for example, they gave you a schedule, do you have exactly according to this schedule it turns on, turns off? Such a vector. Or can it be one thing on paper, but in fact different?

Can be anything. Well, t-today they turned it off half an hour late. Got lucky there. It happens that they can not turn it on for an hour or an hour and a half, delay it. Well you definitely don't have coworking spaces. I don't mean that you can't buy them, but in principle how they... Any coworking spaces in the city or, um, well which ones pay, maybe? There's wifi there.

Yes-yes, just maybe if I... In cafes that work, they have generators, so I'll look. All the same, I need to walk around, ask. And can you find out just in case about coworking spaces and send me links to them, okay, which ones you have there? If there are any, yes, because... Okay. What is it? Coworking- Offices. Yes, yes, yes, yes, special offices, there like, even if there's no electricity, then there usually you buy...

I know, Wilhelm went to one in Vinnytsya, he lives there, and he bought himself a subscription, a subscription for, there, a month somewhere. That is, we need to find out the price. Maybe the company would pay you for this coworking, as an option, right. If it's there, well, not too much money, yes, so that you just... I went like, like, there to work just went for some number of hours there. You just come there, if-

About internet there are such special cables for nine and twelve watts. You need two of them for the power bank. That is, you connect to the power bank, to the router and you have regular internet, with regular, second speed, such stationary. Nastya, and how much does it in general- Light from that same lamp that you turn on, that is. Yes, yes, yes. That is power banks, there, enough. They cost inexpensive, one for a year something one hundred hryvnia, so you need two, maybe less, I don't know. Because then, when they started turning off for us, they cost expensive, four hundred, five hundred I bought and now they don't cost that much anymore. And like, they last more than eight hours.

And how long does your power bank last? Well, you have two. And I have a Mac, Nastya has a Mac, just how many hours does it last so-- I have a Mac, and I, in principle, can also charge it from a power bank. That is, it's mine, I can connect it to anything. When I had Windows, I ran around the local cafes, because Windows you can't connect to anything. In Windows like- You're like with a Power bank. I'm telling you, and like this your Mac lasts longer on charge. I'm telling you, this is two hours with our program. Well and further my Mac lasts, five... Ten hours. Yes. Whatever I do. Can get through this. But again, if you sit on Mac with Illustrator or Designer, it won't last ten hours, five, same. That's also, yes. Maybe, as an option, yes. But I have an old Windows, well like it's, five years-

**Topic: Technical Solutions Discussion - Power Banks, EcoFlow, Battery Life**

Which, there, third it seems, with minimal settings and it lasts, God grant, four hours. Well I'll tell you honestly, even, well when I just bought it, it, uh, was supposed to work five hours. If you just sit on the internet, then yes. If you open our programs, then it's two hours maximum. This is on a just bought laptop. So, well it's just power hungry. Seriously? Yes. It lasted all day. Well that's because you didn't use our programs. Well yes, yes.

Girl in cafe: And I'm not about that, but purely well what I googled, like for work. Yes, they take too much of this, this energy and so on. So, I'm telling you, here you can count on two hours, no more. Well, as an option, well three maximum like, this uh- Girl: There was a project, there was VPN and this such a factured program, so it like, took normally all the same. Understandable, not so much- Design ones, but still.

It would be normal if, for example, you turned off the power there for, uh, four-- for two hours, two hours later turned it on again, again for two- It would charge. And then work, charged, and then it would work.

Vilya bought himself "EcoFlow", yes, a program, link, not a program, but this thing. But again, he said, there it, it seems, lasts about an hour or something like that. Yes. Vil, tell me, how long does your EcoFlow last, on?

I don't have EcoFlow. I have- And you had it before. A Chinese UPS and a two-amp car battery, it can last, well, many hours, only then it will charge for even more hours. Uh-huh. Because you need... So I, I can, it's approximately four hours- Uh, how many hours it will charge, only-only it will be and work. And it can work four hours there. But maybe more, just a car battery you can't like eco word discharge there to twenty percent, because it, it won't survive deep discharge for long, you can discharge it to seventy-five, to fifty without harm to the health of the battery. Battery in four hours it can discharge to fifty, in six hours. And then you still need to charge it. So. Approximately it charges as much as it discharges. Like that.

You can pick- pick up just more expensive there install two batteries and, and find a UPS that charges with more powerful current. Then it will. Vladislav Hanna: Anatoly Khyrko: Charge faster. And this is needed for, uh, for those cases when power, power is uh, a little, uh, and not, doesn't have for long. So for such ca-ca-ca-ca-cases you could still assemble such a configuration so it would charge faster. Well, I haven't assembled yet - I'm like this in my hands. Yes, this I have a UPS for six thousand. It cost me- A car battery costs. It... Cost, it was a little used, so it came out a little cheaper for me than new, well, I assembled for fourteen thousand in my time. Uh-huh. Somewhere like that.

Just if the client, uh, well, sees this, there's just a very picky client, he doesn't like at all- ...if there appear calls and so on, then there will be problems, of course. With this in general, like, well, Europeans don't understand what it's like to sit without electricity. We understand, but they don't. They need everything, no problems, nothing, right. So such-. And for them, for them it happens, only, probably, not so regularly. Well yes, maybe once they would react normally, but I understand that this is not for one time, this...

Oleksandr Okhrimenko: ...as it is itself now will be. Just, just will be, yes. As it is.

Anatoly Khimenko: Well, in principle such a thing, as I have, I have a battery on that. Anatoly Khimenko: ...it can be bought cheaper, for five thousand, maybe. Oleksandr Okhrimenko: Well here... Anatoly Khimenko: It will come out eleven, possibly, thousand. Like that. Well you need to pick it up so that, there, the UPS holds the battery with such current, which- The battery can with-withstand, so as not to overcharge. So that it doesn't charge it with too high current, because it will steam there, steam, be beaten. The battery will also not live long. Yes. Uh-huh.

So what do we have then? For now we don't warn him, or what, that there's no electricity? Let's see for a day or two how this goes in general.

Svitlana Danylenko: Well yes, let's see. Well, let's see today. If there's some song today, then tomorrow, means, we'll write. If it's plus minus...

Iryna Shatalova: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Svitlana Danylenko: ...you'll write there on calls and the work will be done, then okay.

Iryna Shatalova: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Okay.

Iryna Shatalova: Let's do it this way then.

Oleksiy Kulchynskyi: They can fix the electricity any day, like we had there in the past.

Man: ...blackouts. Ah-ah, Man: ...Alina just about ten hours so for a day or two then sat for ten hours without phone, and then suddenly they started. Moderator: Well yes, so I want maybe somehow cover this.

**Topic: Client Project Status - Maria's Work Review**

Well, for now everything seems to suit him. I haven't had time to show him the work I've already done for his project, so I don't know yet. Aha. Well, so, well you need to show at the review or something. Well, you've already shown some work anyway at the review. Well, just my portfolio, for now at the review...

Girl: He dumped a bunch of projects on me that I'll be doing. So for now we just met so he could tell me about my future work, what I'll be doing.

Oleksandr Pedan: You didn't do anything at all for a whole week?

Girl: No, well, no, I worked for a week on one of these projects. Just for now there weren't reviews specifically on my part of the work.

Oleksandr Pedan: Aha, yes, understandable, yes, uh-huh. And here it, probably, is planned, you just in case, there, say when it will be possible to. ...show, that something there write to the manager or someone else, right. Who there is responsible for this, yes? Because we need... Because they're too picky in terms of that for illustrators you can make one style, but it might not suit them, and they'll say some edits, because you need to hear feedback from them to understand in what style to work further, yes, right. They, for example, I made there, maybe there, and once they ask to make an animation there, something we had there, there problems, so we made it one way, but they say there- Oh, no, we need it differently and we'll need to do it differently, right. Uh-huh.

Well they there like al-- already agreed with ???, with the designer on style, I already just communicated with her how to finish the icons. Well, I think, tomorrow we'll meet already for this review. I have almost everything ready here. Yes, and who were you working with? With Yulia, Olya or Kristina?

Well-ll, on this work here, which I almost finished with Kristina. And with Kristina? Uh-huh. Well yes, because we just called last week. Kristina also says there, depending on the project and so on, that when you don't know the project, it's also difficult. One thing you can advise there, but the client has some other vision, so you need to show as an option. The faster you do it, the better. At least, at least show some little part so you catch the style in which he needs you to do this in general. Yes, on, on. Uh-huh. On, in this way. Uh-huh, on. Yes.

Well okay, then. Then go, work and write to me today how it went for you. In principle, today finish working when you can, yes? And further there- Uh-huh. -we'll see, push off from. Write to me how it will be more convenient for you all the same, if something option... Try today if cafes as an option, so one hundred percent we already all pro- ...found out, yes? When it turns off, for example, the laptop, yes? So that you already there, which one is close to you. How to work there and so on. Will it be normal or not?

So, Vil, and does the mic work normally in general? If there's some noise, or do you need really... If she puts on headphones, what will be found out in the cafe. And is everything possible then? I think that headphones won't transmit noise. Well yes. Headphones with microphones, like the microphone says- Uh, external noise pouring. Well yes, well and her voice will be heard better through headphones. Yes. Actually you can even without a meeting room then as an option, yes. Well. Uh-huh.

So such, well in cafes I saw. When, when you sit in coworking, for example, and you need to talk on the mic for, hours, then this can just bother those who walk around there. Ah, well yes. There is, there is basics, that, what, in such a plan. Let everyone put on headphones, four and a half thousand it costs. Excuse me. Well, or it was necessary to do like there, a room for one, like the Chinese have. They love to do everything for one there. It was necessary somehow like that too, a closed room just, isolated, for one. Yes. Yes. And rent it, yes? Well...

With whom I last, I don't even remember on what project, these were also long conversations, so I went in coworking to a soundproof room, so as not to chat in the common room where everyone works, like.

Edik: Uh-huh. Well, yes or you need in general uh, well just entered into the time which you pay. Yes, this room as an option.

Anatoly Mikhelson: And it was included, only it was included. You just had to distribute who at what time would use it. There was a Google calendar in which it was recorded. Yes. I don't want my words... Such hours I'll be subjective in negotiation conditions. Uh-huh. Okay, as an option, yes.

**Topic: Dropbox Migration & Technical Issues**

Well, yes, he said that designers haven't been working long, need to come to them to ask, how are all the accounts, everything how, everything works and what are you doing there. Well I went to them and their guru didn't throw out, and Friday everyone worked for me with fruit and composer. And the subscription for code for 1DD actually wasn't bought. That's why it didn't work. And I wrote to Artemych, asked when everything works for him to come to us and to the designers and everyone logs in again and makes sure everything works.

Yes and have you already switched to Dropbox DD already switched? I haven't switched yet, just need to go there. And what's the principle there - just go into Dropbox and connect to another account and that's it or need to do something else?

Well deleted Dropbox DD, all its packs, all its files so old files don't take up a lot of time. Installed again and logged into 1DD. There was so much garbage that terrible. Basically Dropbox DD needs to be completely deleted yes? Like completely. And it needs to be installed fresh in 2D basically. Oh! Now I'm going to call Natasha I forgot while I remember. Okay disconnecting yes.

**Topic: Natasha Update on New Client Communication**

Speaker: Nastya, just called Natasha. Natasha said, Iris, about Iris immediately asked. She said, for Iris she sent her everything, reported, wrote, etc. She didn't react to it at all. So.

Nastya: Well that she didn't react, that's already her problems. Iris's problems.

Speaker: Yes, Natasha did everything. She said report and sent everything. Then about this new client. Voice over: And she started working. Worked, said on Friday about three hours, but she hasn't written to him anything yet. In this way.

Sophia Stavny: I asked her to write that she like started work and there- Voice over: And to write to him, and then- Sophia Stavny: Well yes. Voice over: But she said that she hasn't written to him anything yet, only started working, about three hours somewhere, no more she said, worked like that. Sync 1. And Because I on Friday sent him the contract again and something he didn't sign it for me over the weekend.

Let's have her now, that he knows there where she works. Let her maybe now... Say that I started work and that's it. Well yes, yes, I asked her on Friday. Now I'll call again then. On-on.

**Topic: Final Follow-up on Natasha & Client Communication**

Katyusha: Ah, yes. Talked with her. She said in this way that in principle she'll write today. But she said that I usually write to him when I have some result. I say: "Just first write to him that I already started working, so he's in the loop." Once.

Halyna Murzak: Well yes I asked him this.

Katyusha: Yes. Well, said okay, I'll write today. Said, asked that she send you a screenshot, uh, how, uh, well, how she'll write to him, m.

Girl: Maybe he'll immediately sign this contract then as an option.

Sophia: Well yes, maybe he didn't see this, doesn't know, didn't notice, forgot.

Girl: Uh-huh. Well, as an option. Why not? Monday started, so to say.

Sophia: Sophia: Really got through?

Girl: Yes. Yes.

Sophia: And with Polina about the website who's doing it?

Tetyana Kulpakes: That's Stas, yes?

Speaker: Yes, yes, yes, with Polina. Although, well, we in principle already talked with you supposedly about Polina. Supposedly Stas is doing it like that, but there you need to find out from the client some list, probably need to make up questions or something. Well she for now, you see, said that she still there, they still have a lot of revision work that still needs to be done, for a week for sure there is, right. And so further already, probably, from next week it would be possible to think about something, right, so, as an option, right. Seven. So such, on. And also wan-- aha.

In principle she doesn't fit into this month because she has a contract until the thirteenth. That's what? Eleven, thirteen. No, until the thirteenth, until the thirteenth she doesn't fit. She, we talked with her. Aha. I'll write, write. Now I'll think of something. Wri-- she has there on the project, she this week just.

Tetyana Kulba: ... she has free time, there, supposedly he doesn't care when she'll work, he wrote to her, and she also wrote there in the chat that she, they agreed that she'll have half a day off, and two days, the twelfth, it seems, just and the thirteenth, she'll work, well not at all in her time, that is however it works out, because she there, she needed two days off,-

Tetyana Vyshynska: Aha.

Tetyana Kulba: -but I convinced her to work on the project, and put days off for us, yes?

Sophia Vavylova: I understood, good. She has there already work with revisions, also with what, with presentations, I understand.

Olena Denysenko: Yes-yes-yes.

Sophia Vavylova: She hasn't gotten to them yet.

Olena Denysenko: To presentations she hasn't even started yet. She said that, yes, uh-huh, which there.

Sophia Vavylova: Well okay, if he continues, then it will be excellent.

Olena Denysenko: Well as an option, just it will be possible for him the same just to attach a developer and that's it. And, by the way, today we have two just new developers started. Could attach one of them, yes? And so developers started? Yes. Well, frontend people supposedly, Artem and Azar.

Well, I saw Artem's interview there it's like, he has the last name Skichko, like Skachko Artem. I'm interested what there, looked through. I remember they published his video interview. There something like that, that I wrote, rejuvenated such a plan. Yes. So this is an option like that.

Nastya, you don't know in general who you need first of all now for video interviews? I just decided that these developers, maybe, were hired because you need them. New ones came? Hi! Yes-yes, two frontend people. Yes. And on Friday I'll have one interview, there need lead gens. Aha, lead gens, then for now lead gens- Lead gens and automators. Well, that's far away already, we already have an automator. Well yes, yes, yes. And so, there on Friday there will be one more, but there same automators, lead gens. Well such, don't know.

And who are automators? Kolya Artemchuk, our LLM people, yes, Kolya Artemchuk and his team, yes. Yes, who these reports help us write and so on. They're configured, these are automators.

And one more question. And, with Maria we agreed to the point that as I see now, the cheapest option is for her, if the company pays for coworking, it costs four eight hundred or four five hundred, yes, per month. Per month or per day? Per month. This is the price for a month, four and a half for a month.

Tetyana Mironenko: She sent me, but she has a problem there that for her to her, to it travel to another bank, forty minutes there. I say: "Well at least you'll work, as an option". Well, I gave her like this: "Today then, - I say, - look for cafes there and so on, there where you could work, yes? Look through all the options that are there, so that you again electricity isn't turned off and so on, because there, you need to sit on the laptop two hours with the turned off option." I told her,-

Girl: ...sit then in Discord, as an option, from mobile phone, because Discord also eats a lot. Well that. And she said: "Okay". Well, energy, well, in principle, we don't need her in Discord. The main thing is that she agreed with them that she'll install Teams mobile version. Checked, supposedly it exists, and I say, so that so, if something there on mobile phone, while you run to the cafe, answer them in mobile phone mode, as an option there.

Blogger: -with laptop, yes. And next to her task pro-- comb through all the cafes nearby where you can sit and charge the laptop, yes. Just I think, just a cafe - this is such an option that she'll come today. If this constantly, for sixteen hours there won't be electricity, there will be many people-

**Topic: Other Team Members' Power Situations**

Man 2: Me, Dasha also tells me that they now supposedly should turn off at eleven. In the empire somewhere on wha-- at seven or, there, hell knows, or at six-

Hanna Fenol: Well yes, but-

Man 2: That is for the whole day they'll turn off power.

Hanna Fenol: Yes, but Dasha has it a bit simpler because she has a tablet that lasts, right, for hours? On which she works in principle. Yes. So, then in principle it's not really so much of a difference regarding this. Well the only thing is maybe there-

Man 2: Well that is that

Blogger: -Uh...

Man: If the connection she has in PD, because there it's unclear what-

Blogger: Mobile should be, yes. Well, I say, it's a bit simpler in this sense, and she has Windows in general that lasts two hours for the laptop and that's it. That is at least, at least two hours is great that it works, because I'm telling you, uh, that's already good. So, and further... Just, well, what we really can the cheapest option offer is the battery, well, I think, if she changed, for example, one battery for another, that would already be four hours.

Rabbit: Girl: But not an option. She doesn't ha-- it's built-in, like, non-removable battery. That is such an option won't work. Further it works out in such a way that we have, well she has this "EcoFlow", these UPS things, so what, it's supposedly okay, but it costs fifteen thousand, she said. That is, supposedly for a long time, if- To buy, but it again lasts, if there won't be so many hours, I don't know how long it will last.

Maybe if, for example, we paid once, maybe it would be normal, but it didn't work. Again we don't know to buy such a thing. The cheapest option is right now for four and a half, this is four eight hundred, this is, um, this coworking. And does our company pay?

Girl: And once there was a period, if project people, all others no. But if on a project, then it's more profitable for us to pay five-- these hundred dollars, yes, a little more. How much is it? Well, two hundred, but not lose the client. Once there was such a variation.

Well, I just don't know what can be thought up. Here the option is: either we just lose the client and that's it, or we pay extra for this coworking for her. Coworking and she at least somehow works. And we don't yet know whether he'll hire her, not hire. The client himself. Well in general normal, writes nothing. Well, for now I told her. Just I understood like this, this coworking is inconvenient for her to travel there.

Yes, I say, then look for options, well, nearby, so you can hire yourself. Yes. Well, I'm telling you, cafes and so on, yes. Yes. I'm telling you that you could quickly find a place where. So that when there's no energy. As an option, I told her: "Maybe while others show their work?" She, and I, by the way, asked her. She still hasn't shown her work at all. And she only worked the whole week with her work and that's it. And, and it's unknown when she, well, will show what he'll say about this in general.

Girl: I already wrote, write to him when you can show. He explained to her many projects, there's a lot she said needs to be done. And for now from what he said, I only worked on one project, didn't work with another. So. And she said that today they don't have a call, supposedly tomorrow it's planned. So that she asks the manager to show the work so he at least somehow we pushed off from this. Right.

Yes, I'm just really she well-ll... Uh because of that he isn't writing. I understood. Because he hasn't seen her work yet, yes. And we're freezing- And when does she plan to do the presentation? Don't know. She also said that they didn't say anything, uh, it varies. Calls they have, she's like present, but she hasn't shown her own work specifically. Yes, such a thing. I understood. Yes, so such, well... Okay, then I'm leaving, that's all. Uh-huh. Yes, all then there. Uh-huh. Good day! All, good day.
