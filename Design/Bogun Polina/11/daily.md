## Activities

### [9:00 - 13:00] - [Designer Onboarding Presentation]
**What I worked on:**
- Received assignment for designer onboarding presentation (received same day)
- Worked with provided presentation plan/outline (not full text, but plan of what should be on each slide)
- Used ChatGPT to generate a prompt for Gamma based on the presentation plan file
- Created presentation in Gamma using the generated prompt
- Encountered issue: Gamma cannot generate images with mascots in the correct style (generates the animal but not in the right style)
- Generated images separately for the presentation
- Used ChatGPT to write detailed prompts for each slide's image
- Generated images for each slide, reviewing and regenerating some that didn't fit
- Rewrote some prompts to get better results
- Completed approximately half of the presentation (small presentation, needs to be finished next time)

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Today I worked with data that I received today. The assignment is a presentation for designer onboarding. That is, a presentation that will be shown to designers. I already had ready text for the presentation. Not text, but a presentation plan and what should be on each slide. So I only needed to create the presentation. I asked ChatGPT to write me a prompt for Gamma based on this file, so I could create the presentation in Gamma. It created it. After that I made the presentation in Gamma. But since Gamma can't create images with mascots - it generates the animal that should be there but not in the right style - I had to generate images separately. After that I asked ChatGPT to write detailed prompts for each image for each slide. I started generating to see if the image suits me or not, so I had to regenerate some images and rewrite prompts. Overall the presentation is small, I should finish it next time. I've already done almost half of the work essentially.]


**Outcomes:**
- Created presentation structure in Gamma using AI-generated prompt
- Generated images separately due to Gamma's mascot style limitations
- Completed approximately 50% of the designer onboarding presentation
- Established workflow: ChatGPT for prompts → Gamma for presentation → separate image generation
- Identified need to finish remaining slides in next session

### [14:25 - 21:00] - [Data Mining]
**What I worked on:**
- Almost finished selecting images for the website
- Applied almost all required changes
- Remaining task: Need to add a couple of links that are missing
- Restructured expertise page based on client feedback: Initially split the page into multiple parts (expertise pages and projects/collaborations page), but client requested everything to be on one page as it was originally on the website
- Completely redesigned the expertise page to combine all sections back into one page
- Continued studying PowerPoint template creation - thought it would be easier but it seems challenging as this is the first time learning about it
- Have very little experience with PowerPoint template creation
- Brainstormed some ideas for PowerPoint themes/templates

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Almost finished selecting images for the website. Also applied almost all changes that were needed - the only thing I didn't do is change the links. More precisely, didn't add a couple of links that were needed. And I changed the expertise page because I had initially split it into several parts - that is, some parts of pages that were originally there, more precisely parts of pages that were there, I split into expertise pages and a projects and collaborations page. But I was told, more precisely the client made corrections saying that everything should be as it was originally on the website - that is, all these parts that I split should be on one page as they were also on one page on the original website, and that's better. So I had to completely change the look of the expertise page. I continued studying the topic of how to make templates in PowerPoint. I thought it would be a bit easier but it seems difficult because I'm only learning about this for the first time and I don't have enough experience in this - basically almost no experience. I brainstormed a couple of ideas for what I can come up with for these templates in PowerPoint.]


**Outcomes:**
- Nearly completed website image selection for Data Mining project
- Applied most required changes from client feedback
- Restructured expertise page to match original single-page layout per client request
- Identified remaining task: Add missing links to the website
- Continued PowerPoint template learning - acknowledged it's challenging due to lack of experience
- Generated initial ideas for PowerPoint template design
- Need to complete link additions and finalize website images

## Notes
- Gamma has limitations with mascot image generation (generates animals but not in correct style) - need to generate images separately
- ChatGPT is useful for generating prompts for Gamma and detailed image prompts for slides
- Client prefers original single-page layout for expertise section over split pages
- PowerPoint template creation is more complex than initially expected - requires more learning and practice

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
