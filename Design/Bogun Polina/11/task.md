## Task 1: Complete Designer Onboarding Presentation

### Steps:
1. Review the current presentation in Gamma to see what slides are completed
2. Check the original presentation plan/outline to identify remaining slides
3. For each remaining slide:
   - Use ChatGPT to generate detailed image prompts if needed
   - Generate images separately (since Gamma has mascot style limitations)
   - Review generated images and regenerate if necessary
   - Add images to corresponding slides in Gamma
   - Ensure content matches the presentation plan
4. Review all slides for consistency in style and design
5. Check that all slides follow the original plan/outline
6. Final review of the complete presentation
7. Export or prepare presentation for delivery

### Resources and Links:
- Current Gamma presentation file
- Original presentation plan/outline document
- ChatGPT for prompt generation
- Image generation tools (separate from Gamma)
- Gamma presentation platform

### Instructions:
Start by opening the Gamma presentation and comparing it with the original plan to identify exactly which slides are missing. For each remaining slide, follow the established workflow: use ChatGPT to create detailed prompts for images, generate images separately (as Gamma doesn't handle mascot styles well), review and refine images, then add them to Gamma. Ensure all slides maintain visual consistency with the completed portion. Once all slides are done, do a final review to ensure the presentation flows well and matches the original plan.

## Task 2: Add Missing Links to Data Mining Website

### Steps:
1. Review client feedback/email to identify which specific links are missing
2. Check the current website design in Figma to see where links should be added
3. Identify the correct URLs/destinations for each missing link
4. Add links to the appropriate elements in Figma design
5. Verify link placement makes sense in the design context
6. Check that link styling matches existing design system
7. Test link functionality if possible in Figma prototype
8. Document the added links for reference

### Resources and Links:
- Client feedback/email with link requirements
- Data Mining project Figma file
- Original website reference (if available)
- Link destinations/URLs

### Instructions:
First, review the client's feedback or any documentation that mentions missing links. Check the Figma design file to understand where these links should be placed. Gather the correct URLs or destinations for each link. Add the links to the appropriate design elements in Figma, ensuring they follow the existing design patterns and styling. If creating a prototype, test that the links work correctly. Make sure all links are properly documented.

## Task 3: Finalize Data Mining Website Images

### Steps:
1. Review current image selection status - identify which images are complete and which need work
2. Check if all required images have been generated/selected
3. Verify image quality and consistency across the website
4. Ensure all images match the design style and requirements
5. Replace or regenerate any images that don't meet quality standards
6. Organize all images in the project folder structure
7. Verify images are properly integrated into Figma design
8. Check image file sizes and optimization if needed
9. Final review of all images in context of the complete website design

### Resources and Links:
- Data Mining project Figma file
- Project folder with images
- Client requirements and feedback
- Image generation tools and resources

### Instructions:
Start by reviewing the current state of image selection - check which images are already in place and which still need to be created or replaced. Verify that all images meet quality standards and maintain visual consistency. If any images need to be regenerated or replaced, do so following the established style guidelines. Ensure all images are properly organized in the project folder and correctly integrated into the Figma design. Do a final review to make sure everything looks cohesive.

## Task 4: Continue PowerPoint Template Learning

### Steps:
1. Review list of saved PowerPoint tutorial videos
2. Watch next tutorial video in the sequence
3. Take detailed notes on key concepts, techniques, and shortcuts
4. Practice the techniques shown in the video by creating a test template
5. Watch additional videos as needed to cover all aspects
6. Experiment with different template features (master slides, layouts, placeholders)
7. Create a practice template to apply learned concepts
8. Document key learnings and create a personal reference guide
9. Identify areas that still need more learning or practice

### Resources and Links:
- Saved PowerPoint tutorial videos
- PowerPoint software
- Microsoft PowerPoint documentation and help guides
- Online PowerPoint template examples for reference

### Instructions:
Continue the learning process systematically. Watch the next tutorial videos in your saved collection, taking notes on important techniques. After each video, practice what you learned by creating test templates. Focus on understanding master slides, layouts, placeholders, and how to make templates reusable. Build your personal reference guide as you learn. The goal is to gain enough confidence to create professional templates for the actual project.

## Task 5: Develop PowerPoint Template Design Ideas

### Steps:
1. Review the brainstormed ideas from today's work session
2. Research PowerPoint template design trends and best practices
3. Consider the Data Mining project's visual style and requirements
4. Sketch out or create rough mockups of template design concepts
5. Consider color schemes, typography, and layout structures
6. Think about different slide types needed (title, content, section dividers, etc.)
7. Refine ideas into 2-3 concrete design directions
8. Create simple visual references or mood boards for each direction
9. Evaluate which direction best fits the project needs
10. Prepare design direction for implementation

### Resources and Links:
- Brainstormed ideas from today's notes
- PowerPoint template design inspiration
- Data Mining project design files and style guide
- Design tools (Figma, PowerPoint) for creating mockups

### Instructions:
Start by reviewing the ideas you brainstormed today. Research current PowerPoint template design trends to inform your concepts. Consider how the templates should align with the Data Mining project's existing visual style. Create rough mockups or sketches of 2-3 different design directions. Think about practical aspects like readability, professional appearance, and ease of use. Refine these into concrete concepts that can be implemented. Choose the direction that best serves the project's needs.
