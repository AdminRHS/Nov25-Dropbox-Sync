## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
Today focused on two main projects:
1. **Designer Onboarding Presentation (50% COMPLETE)**: Created presentation structure in Gamma using AI-generated prompts. Encountered Gamma's limitation with mascot images, requiring separate image generation. Completed approximately half of the presentation. Need to finish remaining slides.
2. **Data Mining Project (NEARLY COMPLETE)**: Almost finished image selection for website. Applied client corrections, including restructuring expertise page back to original single-page layout. Remaining tasks: Add missing links and finalize any remaining images. Continued learning PowerPoint template creation, though it's proving more challenging than expected.
