### Instructions:

Start with Pixelcut as it has proven effective for this task. For each cover:
1. Upload the square cover image
2. Use the canvas expansion feature to extend to 1280x720
3. Use AI generative fill to create appropriate background for extended area
4. Review quality and ensure seamless integration
5. Download and save to folder

Track your progress by noting how many covers you complete per session. If you run out of free credits on one tool, immediately switch to the next tool to maintain momentum. Create new accounts using different email addresses when needed.

4. Check if the quality matches or exceeds current tools
5. Verify free tier limitations (number of images, features, etc.)

In the spreadsheet, update:
- Name and link (verify correct)
- Instructions: Write step-by-step based on your actual testing
- Description: Add any details not previously noted
