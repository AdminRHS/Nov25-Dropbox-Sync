## Task 1: Complete GAME ACADEMY Cover Redesigns with New Requirements

**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** End of week (by November 8, 2025)
**Status:** In Progress (3-4 of ~10+ covers completed)

### Steps:
1. Review Wilhelm's new prompt requirements thoroughly to ensure full understanding
2. Open the working chat that successfully generated 3-4 compliant covers
3. Continue generating remaining course covers one by one using the new prompt
4. Verify each cover has unique clothing/accessories for mascots (no repetition)
5. Check that output matches Wilhelm's specified format requirements
6. Save each approved cover to the project folder
7. If ChatGPT starts lagging or forgetting instructions:
   - Start a fresh chat
   - Paste the working prompt from Wilhelm
   - Test with one cover before continuing with bulk generation
8. Review all covers together to ensure consistency and uniqueness
9. Submit completed covers to Wilhelm for final review

### Resources and Links:
- Wilhelm's updated prompt (added to task requirements)
- Working ChatGPT chat (the one that generated 3-4 successful covers)
- GAME ACADEMY course list
- Project folder for mascot covers
- ChatGPT-5 (specified tool for generation)

### Instructions:
Use the working chat configuration that successfully understood the unique clothing requirement. The key issue from yesterday was ChatGPT memory problems and repeating designs. The new prompt from Wilhelm solved this, so stick with that exact configuration. If performance degrades, immediately switch to a fresh chat rather than fighting with a laggy session. Quality over speed - ensure each mascot has truly unique clothing and accessories.

## Task 2: Send Data Mining Website to Client for Review

**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** Tomorrow (November 6, 2025)
**Status:** Ready to send

### Steps:
1. Do final quality check on completed pages:
   - Projects and Programs page
   - Contact page with form
   - All other main design pages
2. Verify all design elements are polished and professional
3. Check that placeholder content is appropriate or add notes where client needs to update
4. Prepare Figma link with proper sharing permissions
5. Write email/message to client:
   - Summarize what pages are complete
   - Explain what needs their review (content corrections)
   - Mention remaining secondary pages (publications list) will come after their feedback
   - Ask for timeline on feedback
6. Send Figma link to client
7. Set reminder to follow up if no response within 3 days

### Resources and Links:
- Figma file for Data Mining website
- Client contact information
- Project brief/requirements document

### Instructions:
The main design work is complete - Projects & Programs page and Contact page are finished, along with other primary pages. Secondary pages (like publications list) are intentionally postponed until after client feedback, as they require minimal design. Make sure client understands they should focus on content review and corrections for the designed pages. This will prevent rework if they want content changes.

## Task 3: Troubleshoot ChatGPT Performance Issues

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** Before next bulk cover generation session
**Status:** Not Started

### Steps:
1. Document the specific issues experienced:
   - Slow generation speed
   - Frequent lagging requiring page reloads
   - Memory problems (forgetting instructions)
   - Inconsistent behavior between chats
2. Try potential solutions:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try ChatGPT in incognito/private browsing mode
   - Test in different browser (Chrome vs Firefox vs Edge)
   - Check if ChatGPT Plus account is active and not experiencing service issues
   - Start fresh chats more frequently rather than long conversations
3. Test which approach works best with a few test generations
4. Document the working solution for future reference
5. Share findings with team if solution could help others

### Resources and Links:
- ChatGPT account settings
- Browser developer tools for cache clearing
- OpenAI status page (for service outages)

### Instructions:
Yesterday's performance issues significantly slowed down work. Before continuing with the remaining covers, invest time in finding a reliable solution. The issue seemed related to chat memory being full, so shorter chat sessions or fresh chats per batch of 3-5 covers might be the answer. Document what works so you don't waste time on this again.

## Task 4: Complete Secondary Pages for Data Mining Website

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** After receiving client feedback (estimated November 8-10, 2025)
**Status:** Not Started (waiting on client feedback)

### Steps:
1. Wait for client feedback on main pages before starting
2. Once feedback received, implement any requested changes to main pages first
3. Get client approval on revised main pages
4. Review list of secondary pages needed:
   - Publications list page
   - Any other simple content pages
5. Create minimal design templates for secondary pages
6. Apply consistent styling from main pages
7. Add appropriate navigation and linking
8. Final review of complete website
9. Prepare final handoff package for client

### Resources and Links:
- Figma file for Data Mining website
- Client feedback document
- Website content inventory

### Instructions:
These pages require minimal design work - they're primarily content display pages. Don't start until client feedback is received and implemented, as their comments might affect styling decisions for these secondary pages. Keep designs simple and consistent with the approved main pages.
