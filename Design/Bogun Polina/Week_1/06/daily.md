## Activities

### [9:00 - 11:30] - [Redesign covers for Game Academy courses]
**What I worked on:**
-redesigning covers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I continued the redesign of covers for Game Academy. Work was going slowly. Plus I thought that I needed to redo the images that I redid yesterday, since Wilhelm added a new prompt and how they should look, so I started doing them again. But then it turned out that I didn't have to do this. And I could leave the old covers as they were that I made before. So, ChatGPT went crazy again and generated everything very slowly. It again combined several of the last images that it generated. Accordingly, it didn't listen to the prompts I wrote at all. It constantly repeated itself or sometimes generated the wrong mascot that was needed. For example, I generated an image, it added an element from a previous image to that image, and I asked to remove that element. And it generated an image with the previous mascot, just without the element I asked to remove. So. Very often I had to reload the page in Chrome because ChatGPT was working very slowly. Very slowly. That's why the work took a bit longer.]


**Outcomes:**
- Continued redesigning Game Academy course covers
- Encountered technical difficulties with ChatGPT (slow generation, incorrect prompts interpretation)
- Confirmed with Wilhelm that old covers don't need to be redone
- Multiple Chrome page reloads required due to performance issues

### [11:30 - 12:00] - [meeting with team leads]
**What I worked on:**
-call 

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Well, good morning - Polina, hello! Hello! Hi! Hi! Please tell me, are you making the covers for the task? Do you have a lot left? No, specifically to make them square... And to do - well, that is, just redo a bit, literally a couple. And then I'll be changing the sizes. I really don't know how I'll do it because I don't have Photoshop with Firefly. I haven't figured out a way to do all this. And we also wanted to clarify with you about your project, 2 hours, 2 networks. So you need to expand the size from video? Yes. Wilhelm, I think it makes sense to give Marta this task too. She's a graphic designer, it will be even better for her to help with this. Yes. Yes, let's give it to Marta then. You'll do the square ones and Marta will do the extended ones. Yes. And maybe we haven't uploaded all these square versions to a folder or not? No, but I'll upload all this right away. Can you start uploading now? Because the girl will start working on them right now. Well, there's already one square one there that I made. Oh, there is? All the square ones are there? Good, then we'll say so. Okay. That's the first thing. Just yes, Polina, upload them right away to the folder, send them there or Wilhelm can in one folder or how do we have it, one folder or not? Or different? Wilhelm's is already attached, I'm attaching mine. Yes, all. Yes, I think it will be more logical to give her this task, it's more important for us and it takes many attempts to reformat it from one size to another. You mean thumbnails? No-no-no. These are covers. Well, thumbnails like covers for videos, not for videos, but for these courses. For courses? Yes. Yes-yes-yes. This is a bit different, yes. And now Polina, tell me what's going on with the project in general, like it seems we didn't understand if the client has many tasks or not?

Well, so far just the redesign, that is, I already sent the main pages for him to look at, he said that he wants to correct specifically the content that's written, because I just took it from his current website, yeah, and so yesterday I sent it, he wants to review yours, and in general, all that's left to do is to add images there, well, to the website, either generate them or find them, and what else, well, and some kind of intermediary pages that are, well, without design, just text there, because there's, I don't know, some article or something else. Did he tell you before about what you were doing, did he say if he liked everything or not? Yes, yes, we had one call with him, about a week ago, yes, about a week ago I showed him, he asked what and how, then he was asking about what program all this will be done in later, specifically the website itself and for it to be online, but I suspect that, well, I was told that I'm only doing the design and the website itself, that is, the code and so on, will be handled by this developer Stas, I think. I'm not sure. Stas again? I'm not sure who specifically. For me this is our company founder. Well yes, I remember that at the first meeting he said when they approved me that he would take care of this part, and that's why I said that I honestly have no idea about the program where everything will be done. We need to call Kovalskaya because she's at least aware of what's happening there because we have another project like this, oh my. Stas is just in the hospital now, yes, yes, with a ruptured lung, his projects are kind of frozen, yes yes. I just remember that at the very beginning I told Nastya, I think, that I had already done a project once at university, we also did a website redesign and since it was...

That is, she also has html there, all this, code. But the thing is that it can be edited later, if, for example, he needs to change text somewhere or a link or something else, he can do it in a very, well, easy form, where it just says field, here's your text written. Here it's just changed. Well, that is, there's just a text field. He doesn't need to get into the code or anything like that. So I just... well, in theory I can probably do this too through, well, through this, but it will just take me a bit more time because I didn't work directly with it, I was just explained what and how it works there, but I didn't work, that is, I don't know. It depends on the client, yes, if he's willing for me to spend more time on it, because I'll clearly spend more time on it if, well, than yes. Listen, Kovalskaya just wrote that Stas is making a website for Polina's project too. And Kovalskaya writes to me: What? First time I'm hearing this? She's really not having her day today. Found the sales department. I just told her to join us now. Yes, and can you send a link to this story, oh my god, what did I call it, the project that we have. Wilhelm, can you go to Marta on the storyboard right now and tell her what needs to be done, okay? Because I'm afraid I won't even have time to get there. Because she's working with us now, yes. Oh well. I dropped it in the chat. No, here storyboard, story blog yes. And so on. And so Polina, it turns out you were deciding on the call when the very first call probably was with the client, yes, and you were deciding that you're doing the design part of the website, yes, and then Stas is doing the design himself? And did you set any deadlines for when this would be done? No, it was just said as soon as possible. It's just all the same situation as with our other Nastya on the project. And in general, do you know approximately? And will there be some other tasks for designers or not? Because he also told me that it's a long-term project.

Yes. Well, he said that it turns out to finish the website, well, the redesign. And then he'll need to make another two or so presentation designs that he can then also use. That is, not the presentations themselves, but like... Design, layout basically, and then he'll use it for his different presentations. Yes. So there are no other tasks for May yet, right? Well, no, not yet. Nobody told me anything. Okay, well fine. I also wanted to... I need to take two days off next week. Which ones? The 12th and 13th happen to be Thursday and Wednesday, right? Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday and Wednesday. Right? Well, it seems like I'm looking at the schedule. Yes. Here's an option: can you work those dates on the project? And we'll give you a day off. We'll give you half a day off on our side, but on the project then you can still work in the evening when they leave. Either on those dates, or sometime instead of 4 hours, work 8. Then let's do it that way. You definitely have tasks for next week, right? Well for him yes. Yes-yes-yes. That is, there's still a lot to do. For the project there is still, yes. And in general, I'll put in a good word for you, is he normal? Yes, he's such a good Chinese person. I don't know. This was a separate page where text was written, that is, not everything is here, here's some part, for example, these projects lead to another site, that is, not his, but just some external one. But he has, here I haven't completely finished, here he has all these articles, they were already displayed on his website, so it turns out I need to make a separate page for this, like, article. Well, there's just, like, navigation bar, footer and text in the middle, and that's it. That is, such a, actually, frozen page should be there, but... Yes, well, that is, it turns out there are many pages, I see, anyway, like... Didn't he say what his priority is, where he wants something in general? Nothing like that. No, he doesn't really know where to do what, the main thing for him is that it's convenient for him to edit it later. And he can then himself, if anything, change text somewhere or something else. Well, I understand that at this stage he probably, if his site was on Wordpress, he basically knows how to edit on Wordpress, right? Possibly, yes, most likely. Need to clarify with him. Simple option. We'll probably talk more with Nastya. We'll probably need to discuss a list of questions with the developer, I understand. Send this link just in case. It's open, right, not with Figma, the site that we handed over to developers, if anything. Well, that is, like, who will be doing this. Because even Nastya doesn't know that, it turns out, we still need to sell a developer. Well, if he's asking us, I understand, then we have to provide that to him, right? I'll send it in the morning. Yeah, all, thanks. It's view only. Well, it's enough for us just for the developers to look at the visual, you know, and understand what they'll be putting it on and how it will look, right. So yes, that's right.]

### [12:00 - 13:12] -[Redesign covers for Game Academy courses]
**What I worked on:**
-redesigning covers
-organazing folder

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[After the call where they told me and discussed that I can just leave the square images because I don't have Adobe Photoshop Firefly to enlarge them to the required size, and therefore I don't know where I can do this since all other methods are paid or not as effective, so they told me that I can just upload the square images to a specific folder since they exist as ChatGPT generated them, and then another person will enlarge them in Photoshop. And also before this I asked Wilhelm where I can do all this, he said again in Adobe Photoshop and Firefly, but I don't have a subscription so I can't do it there. So I continued redesigning the covers, I have four left to finish. I uploaded all the ready ones to the folder, filled out the Google table in which I indicated the accent in the mascot's clothing and also the new prompt for this image.]


**Outcomes:**
- Confirmed workflow: upload square covers to folder for team member to resize in Photoshop
- Continued redesigning covers - 4 remaining to complete
- Uploaded completed covers to shared folder
- Filled out Google spreadsheet tracking mascot clothing accents and prompts
- Identified limitation: no Adobe Photoshop Firefly subscription for image resizing

### [14:15 - 18:00] - [Data Mining project]
**What I worked on:**
-final toches for the main pages
- email to the client

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Finished with the design of all main pages. Aligned everything a bit. Finished the press page. I'm planning to add filters there. Since there are a lot of publications there. And to make it easier to search later, I want to add filters. Made screenshots of everything. More precisely, I just downloaded all the pages from Figma. And sent them to the client so he could look and make edits. Also I received edits from yesterday's email. There I needed to remove literally a couple of details, which I've already done. Also I gave... access to Figma. To the client, but there was a problem with entering the file and editing it. Because I initially chose that everyone who has the link can edit the file. And for this Figma needs you to have an account. But since he doesn't have an account he couldn't enter. So he asked to solve this problem, informed me about it and asked to solve it. And I researched the question: how to make it so you can view the file in Figma but not create an account. So I fixed this by making access view-only, that is, not for editing the file, and in theory he can now view it, but he said he'll look at it later, asked me to also send him screenshots so he could make edits in reality, so I did that and now I'm waiting for a response with edits.]


**Outcomes:**
- Completed design of all main pages for Data Mining project
- Finished press page design, planning to add filters for easier navigation
- Downloaded page screenshots from Figma and sent to client for review
- Implemented yesterday's client feedback (removed couple of details)
- Resolved Figma access issue by changing permissions to view-only (no account required)
- Sent screenshots to client as alternative way to review and provide feedback
- Awaiting client's feedback and edits
