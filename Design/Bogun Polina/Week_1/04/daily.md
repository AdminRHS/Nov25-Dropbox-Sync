## Activities

### [9:00 - 9:40] - [Thumbnails for empoyees]
**What I worked on:**
- finishing thumbnails for 2 employees

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I finished work on these thumbnails. I created two thumbnails of different sizes for each employee. Overall, I mainly corrected and aligned everything. I double-checked to make sure everything was readable and the accents were placed correctly. I had three thumbnails done, and I completed the fourth one and aligned everything on all four. After that, I sent them to Evelyne to find out if I could already translate these thumbnails into German and French, or if I needed to fix something and make corrections to the original thumbnails.]


**Outcomes:**
- Completed 4 employee thumbnails (2 different sizes for each of 2 employees)
- All thumbnails aligned and checked for readability and proper emphasis
- Sent to Evelyne for review before translation

### [9:40 - 10:45] - [Editing and translating thumbnails for empoyees]
**What I worked on:**
- making some edits in thumbnails
- translating them into german and french languages
- downlowding and fill the table in notion with this task and putting thumbnails in folders

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[After I sent them for review to Team Lead, I received edits. My thumbnail was slightly misaligned, and I missed that there was one letter that was a slightly different size than all the other text. I made all these edits, and after that I was told that I could translate it all into German and French. I translated it using ChatGPT. After that, I added them to a specific Figma file for German and French thumbnails. I also filled in the Notion table with this task, meaning I added all the links, uploaded all these thumbnails, downloaded them and uploaded them to folders on Google Drive. And again, I filled in the table with links. After that, I wrote to Team Lead asking what I could do next and waited for a response with the next task.]


**Outcomes:**
- Fixed alignment and text size issues based on Team Lead feedback
- Translated thumbnails into German and French using ChatGPT
- Added translations to Figma file
- Completed Notion table with all links
- Downloaded and uploaded thumbnails to Google Drive folders
- Awaited next assignment from Team Lead

### [10:45 - 13:00] - [Redesign covers for Game Academy courses]
**What I worked on:**
- redesigning covers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[After I received the assignment, the task was to redesign covers for Game Academy courses again, because they need to be different sizes now and also without text on the image. Wilhelm gave me a link to a chat where I could do all this, which I had also worked in before. When I started working, it was initially difficult to figure out which specific covers needed to be redone because there were a bunch of tables attached to the task and in Notion. At first, I didn't understand at all which ones needed to be redone, but then I went through all the tables and understood which table was current, where to get everything from, where the old ones were located, and what needed to be done. I studied the chat that Wilhelm sent me. Wilhelm also said that the chat should have learned what to do, but because the ChatGPT memory was full, it most likely didn't remember this information. When I sent it the same prompt that Wilhelm used before in this chat - meaning the old image is sent with a prompt for that image, and ChatGPT should have redesigned this image into a new one and written a new prompt and also indicated the accent in clothing so that the prompt and image matched the requirements that Wilhelm initially set in this chat - but again, because the ChatGPT memory was full, it didn't remember this and didn't do anything at all. And for some reason, it's been working very slowly on the admin account lately, which made everything take very long - images were generated slowly, even text prompts were processed very slowly. Because of this, I decided to create a new chat and just redo everything there. It still worked slowly but overall better than in the old chat. Essentially, I trained the new chat. Naturally, since the memory is full on the ChatGPT admin account, it doesn't save memory, but it works fairly well overall. I didn't create that many covers in the end because it was all very slow and I had to redo almost every image three or four times for ChatGPT to understand what I needed and how it should work. Tomorrow, I think the work will go much faster than today because, firstly, I've already trained ChatGPT and I understood what goes where and why, so it should be faster.]


**Outcomes:**
- Received new task: redesign Game Academy course covers (new sizes, no text on images)
- Navigated through multiple tables to understand which covers needed redesigning
- Discovered ChatGPT admin account has memory issues causing slow performance
- Created new ChatGPT chat and trained it from scratch on cover requirements
- Completed several covers (fewer than planned due to technical issues and multiple iterations needed)
- Established workflow for future cover creation that should be faster

### [14:49 - 18:40] - [Data Mining Website]
**What I worked on:**
- Working on Expertise page
- working on project & programs page

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I worked on the website redesign. Overall, I already had a ready structure and more or less the design. That is, I was mainly adjusting some small details, aligning text, and so on. Writing this text. More precisely, taking content from the website that currently exists and inserting it into the new one. And making corrections to the design as well, because a couple of things seemed to look strange and didn't fit, so I had to change them. For some reason, Figma has been lagging a lot lately. Most likely, possibly because I have a lot of things open on my laptop and it's getting overloaded, and I'm just not used to it - because of this, Figma glitches very often and sometimes needs to be restarted. So, I was supposed to send a link today to the finished design with the main pages so that Ariel could review it and make corrections regarding the text, but since I have technical problems with Figma, I simply didn't have time to finish all the pages. I wrote him an email where I explained the whole situation, said that by tomorrow evening I will finish and send him the link and he will be able to make corrections.]


**Outcomes:**
- Worked on Data Mining website redesign (Expertise and Project & Programs pages)
- Refined design details and aligned text elements
- Migrated content from existing website to new design
- Made design adjustments to improve visual consistency
- Experienced technical difficulties with Figma lagging
- Sent email to Ariel explaining delay and committing to deliver by tomorrow evening

- Technical issues encountered: Figma lagging frequently, requiring restarts
- Multiple projects require translation management (German and French)
- Need to improve laptop performance (too many applications open causing lag)
- Successfully established new ChatGPT workflow for Game Academy covers
- Communication maintained with team (Evelyne, Wilhelm, ZIL GAME, Ariel)

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
