## Task 1: Complete Data Mining Website Main Pages

### Steps:
1. Start the day by closing unnecessary applications to improve Figma performance
2. Restart Figma if needed to ensure optimal performance
3. Open Data Mining website Figma file and locate Expertise page
4. Complete remaining design refinements on Expertise page:
   - Align all text elements
   - Check visual consistency with other pages
   - Ensure all content from existing website is migrated
5. Move to Project & Programs page and complete same refinements
6. Review both pages for any elements that "look strange" or don't fit
7. Do final check of all design elements, spacing, and typography
8. Generate shareable Figma link with proper permissions
9. Compose email to Ariel with link and context
10. Send email by evening deadline

### Resources and Links:
- Existing Data Mining website (for content reference)
- Figma design file (Data Mining website redesign)
- Previous email to Ariel (for context continuation)

### Instructions:

Begin by optimizing your work environment - close all non-essential applications to prevent Figma lag. Work systematically through each page section by section. When migrating content from the existing website, copy text into a separate document first to review before placing in design. For each design element that seems "off", step back and compare with successful sections of the design to identify the inconsistency. Save frequently and restart Figma if lag begins. Keep the email to Ariel professional and brief, acknowledging the previous delay and confirming the work is now complete for his review.

## Task 2: Continue Game Academy Course Covers Production

### Steps:
1. Open the new ChatGPT chat created yesterday (not the old admin account chat with memory issues)
2. Review the covers completed yesterday to understand the established pattern
3. Access the correct table in Notion to identify which covers need to be created
4. For each cover:
   - Locate the old cover image
   - Prepare the prompt following Wilhelm's requirements structure
   - Submit old image + prompt to ChatGPT
   - Review generated cover for: correct size, no text on image, proper clothing accent
   - If incorrect, provide specific feedback and regenerate (expect 3-4 iterations per cover)
   - Once approved, save the cover with proper naming convention
5. Work through as many covers as possible, knowing the process should be faster today
6. Document any ongoing ChatGPT performance issues
7. Save all completed covers and update tracking system

### Resources and Links:
- New ChatGPT chat (created on 04.11.2025)
- Notion tables (Game Academy course covers tracking)
- Wilhelm's chat with original requirements
- Google Drive folder for cover storage

### Instructions:

Start with the new ChatGPT chat you trained yesterday - it should remember the requirements better than starting fresh. Before generating each cover, take a moment to clearly formulate the prompt with all necessary elements: size specifications, no text requirement, and clothing accent details. Be patient with the iteration process, but also be specific in your feedback to ChatGPT so it learns faster. Since the chat doesn't save memory due to admin account issues, keep a document open with the core requirements to copy-paste if needed. The work should be significantly faster today since you understand the workflow and have already trained the chat. Set a goal for number of covers to complete and track your progress.

## Task 3: Optimize Technical Setup

### Steps:
1. At start of work day, review all open applications
2. Close applications not needed for current task:
   - Close extra browser tabs
   - Close messaging apps if not actively needed
   - Close any background applications
3. Check laptop resource usage (Task Manager on Windows)
4. Restart Figma before starting intensive work
5. Throughout the day, monitor Figma performance
6. If lag begins, immediately save work and restart Figma
7. Consider working on one project at a time to reduce resource load
8. At end of day, close all applications to prepare for next day

### Resources and Links:
- Windows Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
- Figma desktop application

### Instructions:

This is a preventive task to avoid the technical issues experienced yesterday. Be proactive rather than reactive - don't wait for Figma to become unusable before addressing it. Create a habit of checking what's running before starting design work. If you need to reference something from a website while working in Figma, take screenshots instead of keeping browsers open. Consider using a second monitor or splitting tasks into phases (research phase with browsers open, then close browsers for design phase) to manage resources better.

## Task 4: Monitor ChatGPT Admin Account

### Steps:
1. Continue using the new ChatGPT chat created yesterday
2. Test if the chat retains any information from previous session
3. If memory is lost, have your requirements document ready to re-train
4. Track generation speed and quality throughout the day
5. Note any improvements or continued issues
6. If performance degrades significantly, consider:
   - Creating another new chat
   - Contacting IT about admin account memory issue
   - Finding alternative workflow if needed
7. Document findings for future reference and team communication

### Resources and Links:
- ChatGPT admin account
- New chat created 04.11.2025
- Requirements document for Game Academy covers
- Wilhelm (for technical support if needed)

### Instructions:

This is an ongoing monitoring task. Keep notes on how the ChatGPT chat performs throughout the day - does it get better at understanding requirements, or does it continue to need multiple iterations? If you notice patterns in what prompts work best, document them for future efficiency. The goal is to establish a reliable workflow despite the technical limitation of the memory issue. If you find the chat has completely forgotten yesterday's training, don't get frustrated - just re-train it efficiently using your notes from yesterday about what worked.

## Task 5: Await Next Employee Thumbnail Assignment

### Steps:
1. Check messages from ZIL GAME for new assignment
2. When new assignment arrives:
   - Review assignment details and requirements
   - Clarify any questions immediately
   - Set up Figma file for new thumbnails
   - Apply established workflow from previous thumbnails
3. Create initial thumbnails following previous standards:
   - Two sizes per employee
   - Proper alignment
   - Readable text with correct emphasis
4. Send to Evelyne or designated reviewer
5. Apply feedback efficiently
6. Translate to German and French using ChatGPT
7. Add to appropriate Figma files
8. Download and organize in Google Drive
9. Update Notion table with all links

### Resources and Links:
- Communication channel with ZIL GAME
- Previous thumbnail Figma files (for reference)
- ChatGPT for translations
- Google Drive folder structure for thumbnails
- Notion tracking table

### Instructions:

Since you've already completed this workflow once successfully, you have a proven process to follow. When the new assignment comes, review your previous work to maintain consistency in style and quality. The advantage now is that you know the entire pipeline from creation through translation to file organization, so you can work more efficiently. Keep your translation Figma file template ready so you can quickly add new translations. Maintain the same attention to detail that earned approval on the previous thumbnails.
