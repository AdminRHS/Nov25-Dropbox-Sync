## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
Today was a challenging day with multiple priorities:
1. **Task Prioritization**: Clarified that test assignment is current priority
2. **Team Meeting - Data Mining Project**: Extensive discussion about problematic client with unrealistic expectations. Website redesign is complete, but PowerPoint templates need to be created (only studied so far). Team decided to create 3 template designs, send as PDFs. Client refuses to pay until seeing finished products. Estimated timeframes: presentations 2 days full-time each, website development 1-1.5 months full-time.
3. **Test Assignment**: Completed email campaign creation using ChatGPT + Figma Make workflow. Interview postponed to next week.
4. **Data Mining PowerPoint Templates**: Started creating templates, made first variant, determined color scheme, started applying to presentations.
