## Task 1: Complete 3 PowerPoint Template Designs for Data Mining

### Steps:
1. Review the first template variant already created
2. Analyze what worked well and what needs improvement
3. Create second template design with different visual approach:
   - Different color scheme or layout structure
   - Maintain professional appearance
   - Ensure it matches website aesthetic
4. Create third template design with alternative style:
   - Explore different visual direction
   - Keep consistent quality and professionalism
5. Ensure all three templates are complete and ready for use
6. Export each template as PDF (non-editable format)
7. Prepare presentation document showing all three options
8. Send all three PDFs to client for selection

### Resources and Links:
- First template variant already created
- Website design files for reference
- ChatGPT for design ideas
- Pinterest for inspiration
- PowerPoint software
- Color scheme determined today

### Instructions:
Start by reviewing the first template you created today. Identify its strengths and use that as a foundation. Create two additional distinct designs that offer different visual approaches while maintaining the same level of quality. Each template should be complete enough to show how it would work across all presentation slides. Once all three are complete, export them as PDFs to prevent editing, and send them to the client for selection. The goal is to give the client clear options while protecting your work until payment is received.
