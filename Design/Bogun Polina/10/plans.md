## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
Today was highly productive with three main focus areas:
1. **Course Covers Project (COMPLETED)**: Successfully standardized 50 course covers for Game Academy, resizing them to 1280x720 dimensions using Figma and PixelCut. Discovered a free workaround for PixelCut's image resizing feature. All covers are now uploaded to Google Drive, renamed, and documented in the spreadsheet.
2. **Team Infrastructure**: Resolved Claude subscription access issues and verified Dropbox migration to DD account.
3. **Data Mining Project (IN PROGRESS)**: Applied corrections from Ariel, continued image generation, and started learning PowerPoint template creation for presentation redesigns. Identified blockers: need to clarify website developer assignment and find solution for interactive preview.
