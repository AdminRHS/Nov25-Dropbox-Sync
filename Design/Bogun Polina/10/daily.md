## Activities

### [9:00 - 11:30] - [resizing covers for courses]
**What I worked on:**
- Resizing course covers for Game Academy to ensure all covers match the same style and parameters (1280x720)
- Testing AI tools for image resizing and background generation
- Discovered PixelCut as the most convenient tool and found a free workaround using the chat feature instead of AI editor
- Organized existing covers by size, separating those that already matched dimensions
- Used Figma to create frames of correct size and adjusted images that didn't fit properly
- Regenerated backgrounds using PixelCut for images that needed adjustment
- Completed resizing of 40 course covers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[In the morning I received a task to change the size of covers for courses in Game Academy, as all images for Gaming Academy have been generated - all covers now match one style and the same parameters. I needed to check that they are all the same size, and fix those that weren't the correct size, regenerate AI backgrounds, etc. I also continued my task from before the weekend - searching for AI tools that can do this. I tried several more and PixelCut is the most convenient so far. Plus I found a great workaround: how to use it completely free? Specifically for this function - changing image sizes and regenerating backgrounds. It turns out that if you open these images through the AI editor, you only get three free saves per day. But if you do it through the chat - you just open the chat, upload an image, you don't even need to write a prompt. Just upload the image, click on it, and there will be a reframe option. There you can change the background, regenerate it, change the size, etc., and save. All of this is free and doesn't use any credits. This way I fixed about 40 images - all of them. What I also did: I downloaded all the images, checked their sizes, those that already matched the dimensions I added to a separate folder so as not to mix them up and to see how much work I have. All other images I adjusted to size. The easiest way to do this without stretching the image was through Figma - I made frames of the needed size (1280x720) and inserted images into these frames, adjusting them to the needed sizes. But not all images fit well there, so I had to make them much larger, regenerate the background in PixelCut, and then insert them into Figma so they would all be the same size. So yes, I did this for 40 covers.]


**Outcomes:**
- Successfully resized 40 course covers to standard dimensions (1280x720)
- Discovered free method to use PixelCut for image resizing and background generation
- Organized workflow using Figma for frame standardization and PixelCut for background regeneration
- All covers now match the required style and parameters

### [11:30 - 11:50] - [Claude sign in ]
**What I worked on:**
- Team call with Yulia, Vilgeim, and Svet to set up Claude DD account in Cursor
- Verified connection to the new subscription account
- Migration from admin account to DD account in Dropbox (already completed last week, verified during call)

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Then Yulia, Vilgeim, and Svet joined a call and saw that we have a DD account connected for Claude in Cursor, as they bought a subscription. There was a problem - they had mentioned this on Friday or Thursday that the subscription exists. But in fact, there was no subscription and it was only purchased today. Because of this, on Friday we couldn't write a proper report because all accounts ran out of subscription or the uses of this subscription ended or something else. In short, we couldn't write a proper report. That's why they came to us and helped us log into the DD account in Claude and also checked if we were connected. We did a migration from the admin account to the DD account in Dropbox. Since I had already done this last week, they just checked me and said that I have everything set up and that's it.]


**Outcomes:**
- Successfully connected to Claude DD account in Cursor
- Verified Dropbox migration was already completed correctly
- Resolved subscription access issues that prevented report writing on Friday
- Team now has proper access to Claude subscription for future work

### [11:50 - 13:00] - [resizing covers for courses]
**What I worked on:**
- Continued resizing course cover images after the call
- Completed all 50 course covers that needed to be resized
- Consulted with Vilgeim about next steps for the completed covers
- Saved all images from Figma in the correct size (1280x720)
- Uploaded all covers to Google Drive folder
- Renamed all images to match their corresponding course names
- Updated spreadsheet with links to each cover

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[After the call I continued changing the size of images. I did everything the same way and thus completed all 50 covers that existed. After that I wrote to Vilgeim. Asked that all images and all covers are ready. What should I do with them? Like can I transfer them to Google Drive in a folder? Replace? Because the old images were different sizes, now they're all the same, and also add them to the table. He said I can do this. So I saved all images from Figma in the needed size. Uploaded them to a folder on Google Drive and then renamed everything. So that each image is named after the course for which this image was created. And then I filled in the table with a link to each cover.]


**Outcomes:**
- Completed all 50 course covers with standardized dimensions
- All covers uploaded to Google Drive and properly organized
- Each cover renamed to match its course name for easy identification
- Spreadsheet updated with links to all covers for easy access
- Project completed and ready for use

### [14:00 - 18:00] - [Data Mining project]
**What I worked on:**
- Received email from Ariel over the weekend with corrections and information on what needs to be done
- Received three presentation files from Ariel via separate email
- Understood workflow: need to create three different designs, select one, then redesign all other presentations and create a PowerPoint template/layout for future use
- Continued generating images for the website
- Applied corrections from Ariel's email
- Researched how to enable interactive preview (clicking buttons, following links) - needs Figma account which is complex
- Contacted Nastya (sales manager) to clarify who will develop the website and who will act as developer
- Watched tutorial videos on creating reusable PowerPoint presentation designs/templates
- Saved additional tutorial videos for further learning on PowerPoint template creation

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Over the weekend I received an email from Ariel with corrections and information on what needs to be done. Also, I asked him, or rather Alina asked him about presentations. He also sent me presentations in a separate email, which contained three presentations. He also described how we work on the topic. I need to send him three different designs and then we'll choose one we want, and then redesign all other presentations and also make it as a layout/template in PowerPoint so that it's more convenient for him to apply this design to his future presentations and not have to ask someone else. So today I continued generating images for the website and also applied corrections that were sent to me in the email that Ariel indicated. There's also a question about him wanting to see how everything looks - like clicking buttons, following links - but I'm not sure yet how to do this correctly as he needs a Figma account to do this and it's quite a difficult process and I don't know how to solve this. I also wrote to Nastya, the sales manager, about who will actually develop the website, specifically who will act as the developer, as it's unclear what to do with this. Also today I watched a video on how to create this design in PowerPoint so it can be applied to other presentations. The video was generally understandable but it mainly showed that all slides look the same but with one design. So I plan to watch a couple more videos - I saved several different videos and will also watch them to be more knowledgeable on this topic and understand how to do it. I don't have much experience working with PowerPoint, especially creating presentation designs that can be reused.]


**Outcomes:**
- Applied corrections from Ariel's email to the Data Mining project
- Continued image generation for website
- Clarified presentation workflow: create 3 designs → select 1 → create PowerPoint template
- Identified need to research interactive preview solutions for Figma prototypes
- Reached out to sales manager to clarify developer assignment for website
- Started learning PowerPoint template creation through tutorials
- Need to watch additional videos to fully understand reusable template creation

## Notes
- PixelCut chat feature provides unlimited free image resizing and background generation (workaround for 3 saves/day limit in AI editor)
- Need to follow up on website developer assignment and interactive preview solution for Data Mining project
- PowerPoint template creation requires more research and practice
- All 50 course covers successfully standardized and organized

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
