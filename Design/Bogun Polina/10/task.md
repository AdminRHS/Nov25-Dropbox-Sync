## Task 1: Complete Data Mining Presentation Designs

### Steps:
1. Review the three presentation files received from Ariel to understand content structure and requirements
2. Analyze existing presentation styles and identify key design elements needed
3. Create first design concept focusing on modern, professional aesthetic
4. Create second design concept with different color scheme and layout approach
5. Create third design concept exploring alternative visual style
6. Ensure all three designs maintain consistency within each concept but offer distinct visual approaches
7. Prepare design presentation document showing all three options side-by-side
8. Send three design options to Ariel for review and selection

### Resources and Links:
- Three presentation files from Ariel (received via email)
- Figma for design creation
- Design inspiration resources (if needed)
- Ariel's email with project requirements and corrections

### Instructions:
Start by thoroughly reviewing all three presentation files to understand the content, structure, and any specific requirements mentioned in Ariel's email. Create three distinct design concepts that each offer a unique visual approach while maintaining professionalism. Each design should be complete enough to show how it would look across all slides. Use Figma to create the designs, ensuring they can be easily converted to PowerPoint later. Once all three designs are complete, prepare a comparison document and send to Ariel for selection.

## Task 2: Resolve Data Mining Website Development Questions

### Steps:
1. Follow up with Nastya (sales manager) regarding website developer assignment
2. Research options for enabling interactive Figma prototype preview without requiring client Figma account
3. Consider alternative solutions:
   - Figma prototype sharing links with view-only access
   - Exporting interactive prototype to other platforms
   - Creating a simple HTML/CSS prototype for client review
4. Document pros and cons of each solution
5. Present solution options to team/client for decision
6. Implement chosen solution for Ariel to preview interactive elements

### Resources and Links:
- Figma documentation on prototype sharing
- Contact: Nastya (sales manager)
- Figma prototype features documentation
- Alternative prototyping tools (if needed)

### Instructions:
First, reach out to Nastya to clarify who will be responsible for website development. Simultaneously, research Figma's prototype sharing capabilities - Figma allows sharing prototypes via links that don't require the viewer to have an account. Test this feature and document the process. If this doesn't meet requirements, explore alternative solutions like exporting to other platforms or creating a simple web-based prototype. Present all viable options with recommendations to the team for a decision.

## Task 3: Create PowerPoint Template from Selected Design

### Steps:
1. Wait for Ariel's selection of preferred design from the three options
2. Review saved PowerPoint tutorial videos on template creation
3. Watch additional tutorials if needed to fully understand the process
4. Open PowerPoint and create a new template file (.potx format)
5. Set up master slides based on the selected design:
   - Title slide layout
   - Content slide layout
   - Section divider layout
   - Any other slide types needed
6. Apply design elements (colors, fonts, graphics) from selected Figma design
7. Create reusable elements and placeholders for text and images
8. Test the template by creating sample slides
9. Ensure template is easy to use and apply to existing presentations
10. Send template file to Ariel for review and feedback
11. Make adjustments based on feedback
12. Finalize template and provide instructions for use

### Resources and Links:
- Selected design from Ariel (after review)
- Saved PowerPoint tutorial videos
- PowerPoint template creation guides
- Microsoft PowerPoint documentation

### Instructions:
After Ariel selects a design, carefully study PowerPoint template creation through the saved tutorial videos. Focus on understanding master slides, layouts, and how to make templates reusable. Convert the selected Figma design into PowerPoint format, paying attention to maintaining visual consistency. Create multiple slide layouts within the template to cover different content types. Test the template thoroughly before sending to ensure it's user-friendly and works as expected. Provide clear instructions on how to apply the template to existing presentations.

## Task 4: Complete PowerPoint Template Learning

### Steps:
1. Review list of saved PowerPoint tutorial videos
2. Watch first tutorial video on template creation basics
3. Take notes on key concepts and techniques
4. Watch second tutorial on advanced template features
5. Practice creating a test template to apply learned concepts
6. Watch additional videos as needed
7. Create a reference document with key learnings and shortcuts
8. Practice converting a sample design to PowerPoint template format

### Resources and Links:
- Saved PowerPoint tutorial videos (from personal collection)
- PowerPoint documentation and help guides
- Online PowerPoint template examples for reference

### Instructions:
Dedicate focused time to learning PowerPoint template creation. Watch the saved tutorial videos systematically, taking notes on important techniques. After each video, practice the concepts by creating test templates. Build a personal reference guide with shortcuts and best practices. The goal is to feel confident in creating professional, reusable templates before starting the actual project work.

## Task 5: Continue Data Mining Website Image Generation

### Steps:
1. Review Ariel's email corrections and requirements for website images
2. Identify which images still need to be generated
3. Continue generating images according to project specifications
4. Ensure all images match the design style and quality standards
5. Organize generated images in project folder structure
6. Update design files with new images
7. Verify all images are properly integrated into the website design
8. Prepare image assets for developer handoff (if applicable)

### Resources and Links:
- Ariel's email with corrections and requirements
- Figma design files for Data Mining project
- Image generation tools and resources
- Project folder structure

### Instructions:
Continue the image generation work that was started today. Follow the corrections and requirements outlined in Ariel's email. Maintain consistency in style and quality across all images. Keep images organized in the project folder and update design files regularly. Ensure all images are ready for integration into the final website.

## Task 6: Implement Interactive Preview Solution

### Steps:
1. Research Figma prototype sharing options (view-only links)
2. Test creating a shareable prototype link that doesn't require Figma account
3. Verify that interactive elements (buttons, links) work in shared prototype
4. If Figma sharing works, document the process and create a guide
5. If Figma sharing doesn't meet requirements, explore alternatives:
   - Export to interactive PDF
   - Create HTML/CSS prototype
   - Use other prototyping platforms
6. Test chosen solution thoroughly
7. Create instructions for Ariel on how to access and use the preview
8. Share preview link/solution with Ariel and gather feedback
9. Make adjustments based on feedback

### Resources and Links:
- Figma prototype documentation
- Figma sharing and collaboration features
- Alternative prototyping tools (if needed)
- Data Mining project Figma file

### Instructions:
Start by testing Figma's built-in prototype sharing feature - it typically allows sharing via a link that works without requiring the viewer to have a Figma account. Create a prototype from the design, test the sharing link, and verify all interactive elements work. If this solution works, document it clearly. If not, research and test alternative solutions. The goal is to provide Ariel with an easy way to interact with the design without complex setup processes.
