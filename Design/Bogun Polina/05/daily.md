## Activities

### [9:00 - 13:00] - [Redesign covers for Game Academy courses]
**What I worked on:**
-redesigning covers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Continued working on redesigning covers for GAME ACADEMY, for the courses I worked on yesterday. I redid about ten covers, I think. It all took a very long time because ChatGPT was generating very slowly. It lagged very often, so I had to reload the page. It often didn't understand, it didn't remember what was needed from it. That is, I tell it the instructions, I say: will you do exactly the same next time? It says: yes, of course I will. But literally you send it the next image with a prompt so that it changes it according to the requirements needed, and it forgets everything you told it. I think this is because the ChatGPT memory is full. That's why ChatGPT doesn't remember anything at all, everything generates very strangely, again even text generates very slowly, well text messages not images, even when you just ask it to write something it takes a very long time. Then I was doing all this in one chat that was specifically in the folder for generating mascots, then I thought it would better generate mascot images if it already knows in a chat where it knows how to generate mascots and what style they should be in, but unfortunately no, for some reason it worked slower, so I decided to return to the chat that I started yesterday, but for some reason yesterday in this chat the work went poorly, today it went better, and also I decided, no I saw that Wilhelm my Team Lead added a new prompt to the task by which you can ask ChatGPT-5 to make these images and also what the output should be, that is what image should ultimately be obtained. I realized that almost all my images don't meet these requirements, and so in the new chat that I used yesterday, I decided to start redoing the images specifically according to this prompt that was roughly speaking given before, and I started generating images, they generated very quickly and ChatGPT finally started to understand that the clothing should be unique, well that is the accent of clothing should be different on each image, because in my previous chat it repeated clothing despite the fact that I told it that clothing should be unique and that it should not repeat clothing on mascots. As a result, in the new chat I managed to make 3-4 images and will continue work tomorrow.]


**Outcomes:**
- Redesigned approximately 10 course covers for GAME ACADEMY
- Experienced significant ChatGPT performance issues (slow generation, lag, memory problems)
- Discovered new prompt requirements from Team Lead Wilhelm that previous designs didn't meet
- Switched to new chat with updated prompt, which improved results significantly
- ChatGPT finally understood unique clothing requirement for mascots
- Successfully generated 3-4 covers meeting new requirements
- Need to continue redesigning remaining covers to match new specifications

### [14:00 - 18:00] - [Data Mining Website]
**What I worked on:**
-working on project & programs page
-working on contact page


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Continued work on the website. Completely finished the Projects and Programs page, also finished the page with contacts, that is, how you can get in touch, which has a form, and I will also send a Figma link to the pages that already exist, that is, the main pages, some pages where there will literally just be a list of all publications I haven't done yet, I will do them all, such secondary pages where design isn't particularly needed. So, the main part of the pages with design I have done, I will send the link to the client so that he can correct the content that is on these pages.]


**Outcomes:**
- Completed Projects and Programs page design
- Completed Contact page with contact form
- Finished main design pages for the Data Mining website
- Prepared Figma link with completed pages for client review
- Remaining work: secondary pages (publications list, etc.) that require minimal design
- Ready to send to client for content review and corrections

## Notes
- ChatGPT performance was problematic today - frequent lagging, slow generation, and memory issues
- Important: Wilhelm added new prompt requirements for GAME ACADEMY covers that need to be followed
- New chat with updated prompt works much better for generating mascots with unique clothing
- Data Mining website main pages are complete and ready for client feedback

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
