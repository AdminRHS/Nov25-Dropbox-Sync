## Course Thumbnail Design Guidelines

### Overview
Creative thumbnails are required for all courses on Game Academy. Each thumbnail must be unique, beautiful, and creative while preserving a common visual style.

### Core Requirements

#### Essential Elements
Each thumbnail **MUST** contain:
1. **Mascot** - The department mascot for which the course is intended (or the common mascot)
2. **Title** - The course title, incorporated creatively into the scene
3. **Big Icon** - A large icon representing what the course is about (e.g., a tool the course teaches to use)

#### Mascot Placement
- Mascot must be in **their natural habitat** (environment appropriate for that animal)
- Title and icon must be **incorporated nicely and creatively** into what's happening in the thumbnail
- Mascot should be interacting with the environment and course elements

#### Visual Style Consistency
- All thumbnails must preserve **common visual style**
- Each thumbnail plot must be **unique**
- Maintain visual cohesion across all thumbnails

### Uniqueness Requirements

#### What Must Be Unique Per Thumbnail
- **Objects on the background** - Different background elements for each thumbnail
- **Objects mascot is interacting with** - Unique interactions per course
- **Activities** - Different activities/scenarios
- **Poses of the mascot** - Unique poses for each thumbnail
- **Objects in mascot's hands** - Especially important - must be unique each time

#### Restrictions for Uniqueness
- If an original mascot prompt mentions objects they're holding, **don't follow that object-related part** for thumbnails
- If an object or mascot pose was used once, **don't use it again**
- **Tablets and monitors** - Don't use on more than one picture maximum

### Critical Restrictions

#### No Devices Allowed
**STRICTLY PROHIBITED:** The following devices are **NOT ALLOWED** in Game Academy thumbnails:
- Tablets
- Phones
- PCs
- Laptops
- Any electronic devices
- Monitors (maximum one use across all thumbnails)

**Reason:** To maintain creativity and avoid repetitive technology-focused imagery

### Design Process

#### Prompt Requirements
Each thumbnail prompt must include:
1. **Detailed mascot description** - Full character description
2. **Very detailed environment description** - Natural habitat with specific details
3. **Course title integration** - How title appears in the scene
4. **Icon integration** - How the course icon is incorporated
5. **Explicit device restriction** - Reminder that no devices are allowed

#### Prompt Structure
```
[Mascot Name] - [Department]
[Mascot detailed description]
[Environment: Detailed natural habitat description]
[Course Title: How it appears in the scene]
[Course Icon: Large icon representing course topic, creatively integrated]
[Restriction: No devices allowed - tablets, phones, PCs, laptops, monitors]
[Unique elements: Objects, poses, activities that haven't been used before]
```

### Technical Specifications

#### Thumbnail Dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **Size:** Standard 16:9 format (e.g., 1920x1080px for high resolution)

3. **Plan the scene** - Natural habitat, unique scenario, creative integration
4. **Verify restrictions** - No devices, unique elements, proper mascot usage

#### During Creation
1. **Follow mascot specifications** - Use correct character description
2. **Incorporate elements creatively** - Title and icon integrated naturally
3. **Maintain visual consistency** - Common style across all thumbnails
4. **Ensure uniqueness** - New objects, poses, activities for each thumbnail

#### After Creation
1. **Review against requirements** - Check all elements present
2. **Verify uniqueness** - Confirm no repeated elements
3. **Check restrictions** - No prohibited devices
4. **Quality check** - Professional rendering, proper dimensions

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### ❌ Don't:
- Use devices (tablets, phones, PCs, laptops, monitors) - Maximum one monitor across all thumbnails
- Repeat objects, poses, or activities from previous thumbnails
- Use mascot's original prompt objects in their hands
- Create scenes that don't match mascot's natural habitat
- Overcomplicate the scene - keep it clear and readable

- Research each mascot's natural habitat
- Create unique scenarios for each course
- Integrate title and icon creatively into the scene

- Use unique objects in mascot's hands for each thumbnail
- Keep the design clear and the course topic obvious
