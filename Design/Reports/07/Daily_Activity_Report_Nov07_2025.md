## 15. Data Quality Note

**Employee Documentation Status:**
- ✅ **Kucherenko Iuliia:** Extensive documentation with detailed transcripts, client discussions, and project details
- ⚠️ **15 Other Designers:** Template files only - No activity documented for Nov 7

**Employee List:**
Shelep Olha, Bogun Polina, Chobotar Yuliia, Hlushko Mariia, Litvinova Natalia, Rotar Olga, Safonova Elleonora, Shtepa Yuliia, Shymkevych Iryna, Skrypkar Vilhelm, Syrotiuk Mariia, Teselko Anastasiya, Vereteno Marta, Yarmachenko Kristina, Bykova Anastasiia

**Note:** The lack of documentation from 15 employees likely indicates incomplete daily logging practices rather than inactivity. Based on discussions, multiple designers are actively working on client projects, but not documenting their work in the 07 folder daily.md files.

**Recommendation:** Implement mandatory daily logging with accountability checks to ensure department-wide compliance.
