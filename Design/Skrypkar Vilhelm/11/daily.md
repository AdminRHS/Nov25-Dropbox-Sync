## Activities

### [09.00 - 10.30] - [Creating and assigning task for creating designers onboarding presentation]
**What I worked on:**
- Assigned Polina Bagun to create the design department onboarding presentation
- Provided detailed task description and resources
- Explained the workflow: AI prompt generation → illustration generation → editing → final presentation in Gamma

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

At the beginning of the day, Polina Bagun told me that she had finished all the covers for the game Keds. And she now needed a new task. For some time now, we had a pending task to create a presentation for onboarding new designers in the department. A week or two ago, I wrote a kind of script for the presentation - a brief plot with texts that should be on the slides and descriptions of what should be in the illustrations. And today Polina received the task to create this presentation. Polina should handle this well because she has already made presentations for HR, which they also used for onboarding. In Polina's task, it was explained that she needs to generate prompts in artificial intelligence for creating this presentation in Gamma. She needs to generate prompts for illustrations on the presentation slides, generate the pictures themselves, the illustrations for the slides. According to the presentation plot, some pictures should feature portraits of department administration and screenshots from applications. Therefore, after the illustrations are generated, they will need to be edited, possibly in Photoshop or some graphics software, to insert real screenshots and photos of people into the illustrations. And she should also generate the presentation itself in Gamma with these illustrations and save all materials in the materials folder. Here is the task explanation from Polina's task:

Create presentation for design department onboarding. Presentation is supposed to be shown to new designers of RH on the second day of their work when they arrive at the department. By then they have already been initially onboarded by HRs on the common rules of Remote Helpers. Now, the onboarding in the design department guides them through department's working processes and rules. It's like the teamleads of the department explain new employees how they're going to work, which tools to use, connect them to the working accounts, etc - but now it's in the form of a presentation.

The presentation has to be 1920*1080. Almost every slide has to have section(s) of text and illustration, so Gamma will be an appropriate tool for that.

Create illustrations for slides using ChatGPT or other AIs. Use the Hummingbird mascot of the design department on illustrations. Some of the illustrations have to contain screenshots from actual software and portraits of design department administration, use graphic software to combine those graphics with generated illustrations.

Make AI (ChatGPT) create prompts for actual slides to create the presentation in Gamma and store the prompts in the folder for materials

Make AI (ChatGPT) create prompts for generating illustrations and store the prompts in the folder

Generate illustrations and store them in the folder

Edit illustrations if they need to have screenshots of actual software or portraits of admins, store final illustrations in the folder for materials

Generate the presentation in Gamma, export in all formats and store in the folder for materials, attach the link to Gamma to this task.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully assigned comprehensive onboarding presentation task to Polina Bagun
- Provided clear workflow and all necessary resources (script, folder, guidelines)
- Task leverages Polina's previous experience with HR onboarding presentations

### [10.30 - 12.00] - [Checking on mascot creation progress]
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed mascot generation progress with Yulia Kucherenko and Anastasia Bykova
- Evaluated generated bird mascots for 3D designer and graphic designer professions
- Made decisions about mascot diversity and uniqueness

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Next, Yulia Kucherenko and I checked the progress on creating mascots for the design department professions. Anastasia Bykova generated various birds that should become mascots for the 3D designer and different types of parrots that will be the mascot for the graphic designer. As a result, we decided that we need to try to generate some even more unique birds so that all mascots differ significantly from each other. And we also decided to remove the old mascot for the UI/UX designer profession - it was a falcon mascot. We decided to remove it because it also didn't stand out enough and differ from other birds. Anastasia Bykova will continue working on this task.

**Outcomes:**
- Identified need for more unique and distinctive bird designs for profession mascots
- Decided to remove the falcon mascot for UI/UX designer due to insufficient visual differentiation
- Anastasia Bykova to continue generating more distinctive bird mascots for the library

### [12.30 - 15.00] - [Creating the portrait of Artem Skichko]
**What I worked on:**
- Created employee portrait for new developer Artem Skichko
- Followed standard portrait creation workflow
- Prepared and uploaded final portrait to CRM

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

Today I created a portrait for the new developer Artem Skichko. The creation process was the same as for all portraits recently. Created a 1000x1000 frame in Figma. The PNG of the generated portrait was cropped at the waist and pasted into the frame. So in the frame it's already cropped at the shoulders. The portrait was converted to webp and uploaded to CRM. The portrait is ready.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully created portrait for Artem Skichko following standard process (1000x1000px Figma frame, shoulder crop)
- Converted to webp format and uploaded to CRM
- Portrait ready for use in employee database

### [15.00 - 18.00] - [Creating instruction on how to put logo and change the background on the picture with clothing model and then animate it]
**What I worked on:**
- Provided consultation to Anastasia Kovalskaya and Anush Iskandarova on AI-based image editing workflow
- Demonstrated how to place logos on clothing photos and animate them
- Created video tutorial documenting the complete process

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

In the afternoon, Anastasia Kovalskaya and Anush Iskandarova came to the designers' chat. On Anush's project, a new version of a clothing advertising and sales website is being created. The site has photos of clothing and sometimes photos of people wearing the clothing. Anush's client wants a feature to place logos - so that the client can do it themselves and see what the products look like with their logo. And they also want to animate these pictures. How to make it all happen automatically on the website so the client only needs to upload the logo? I don't know because that's not my area of expertise. But Anush and Anastasiya asked me to explain to Anush how to do it manually using artificial intelligence. That is, how to place a logo on an existing photo of a model in clothing and how to animate it. I explained how to do it - how to give Nabla Banana two photos and say "put this logo on this hat, for example." Also how to make some adjustments if, for example, the text on the logo is the same color as the hat and won't be visible - that is, to have Nabla Banana invert the text colors. And then I showed how to animate the resulting picture with the placed logo in Runway. And to animate in Runway, it's preferable to first ask the artificial intelligence to generate a prompt for animating in Runway. I showed by screen sharing how it all works - showed how the image is generated in Nabla Banana, then showed how to remove the watermark that Nabla Banana puts on the picture. Showed what Runway is and how to insert a picture into it and where to write the prompt. Showed how I described the prompt in ChatGPT and showed the final result. Uploaded both the generated picture and generated video to the folder for their out-staffing work. Anush said she understood everything and they left with Anastasia. After that, I used Akam to record the same process myself and thus created a video instruction on how to do this - place a logo on a clothing photo and then animate it.

## Notes
- Polina Bagun has proven experience with onboarding presentations, making her ideal for the design department onboarding project
- Mascot library needs more visual diversity - current birds are too similar
- Standard portrait process is working well: 1000x1000px frame, shoulder crop, webp conversion
- AI tools (Nabla Banana + Runway) provide effective workflow for logo placement and animation on product photos
- Video tutorials are valuable for documenting AI workflows for the team

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
