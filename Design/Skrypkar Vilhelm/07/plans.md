## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Majority of Academy course covers were edited today, with a subset still pending.
- Polina was assigned to research AI methods for resizing/filling images because Firefly free credits were exhausted.
- Announcement text for new Claude subscriptions is drafted; images require one re-generation and cleanup.

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. Finish remaining Academy course covers
   - Goal: Complete all remaining course cover images in Academy size (1280×720) with focal content on the right and neutral left background.

   - Deadline: 2025-11-08 EOD
   - Owner: Vilhelm (primary), Polina (support)

2. Establish reliable AI/image resizing & fill workflow
   - Goal: Identify 3 viable tools/methods (AI or traditional + AI) that can resize/shift content and fill backgrounds automatically or semi-automatically.
   - Expected outcome: New tab in AI Research spreadsheet with tool names, links, costs, example outputs, pros/cons, and recommended workflow.
   - Deadline: 2025-11-09 midday
   - Owner: Polina (research), Vilhelm (validation)

3. Finalize and post Claude subscription announcements

### Low Priority
1. Experiment with alternative tools and document quick tests

   - Expected outcome: Short notes in AI Research tab with example outputs and cost estimate.
   - Deadline: 2025-11-12
   - Owner: Polina
