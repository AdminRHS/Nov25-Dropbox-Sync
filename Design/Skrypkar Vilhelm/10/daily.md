## Activities


### [09.00 - 11.00] - [Department working processess talks]
**What I worked on:**
- Participated in administration chat discussions about department operations
- Reviewed project situations and team member status
- Discussed power outage challenges affecting Ukraine-based workers
- Evaluated solutions for maintaining productivity during electricity disruptions


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[At the beginning of the day, in the administration chat, we discussed the department's work, the situation on projects, and discussed power outages in Ukraine that affect workers who are located in Ukraine. Right today, things are worst for Svyatoslav Podolsky, who was supposed to get electricity for only two hours during the day, and things are also very bad with electricity for Maria Glushko, who also won't have it for many hours. We discussed what the solution to this problem might be for Maria while she's working on the project, and came to the conclusion that she needs to look for coworking spaces in the city, and possibly our administration will pay for her stay in the coworking space for the duration of her project.]




**Outcomes:**
- Identified critical power outage issues affecting Svyatoslav Podolsky (only 2 hours of electricity expected)
- Recognized Maria Glushko's severe electricity limitations during active project work
- Decided on coworking space solution for Maria
- Administration agreed to potentially cover coworking costs during her project period

### [11.00 - 12.00] - [Department migration to dd account on Dropbox, reconnecting to Cursor and Claude]
**What I worked on:**
- Coordinated department-wide migration from admin Dropbox to dd@rhs.com account
- Assisted team members who hadn't migrated yet with Nikolai Artemchuk's guidance
- Resolved Cursor and Claude access issues that plagued the department on Friday
- Helped configure GitHub connections for all team members


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[Today, with the help of Nikolai Artemchuk, who joined our department chat, those who hadn't migrated yet moved from the admin Dropbox to the dd@rhs.com Dropbox. We migrated under Artemchuk's guidance. Back on Friday, our entire department was experiencing very big problems with Cursor and Claude's operation. In Cursor, they were getting error 400, which means the tokens for its operation ran out. Those who tried to log into the dd Claude account discovered that the subscription to Claude on dd was actually not paid, even though on Friday they announced that it was paid. So today the subscription was paid, Artemchuk came to us and showed everyone in the department how to log out of the admin account in the code and log into the dd account, how to connect GitHub, and so on. As a result, all department workers connected their working code, tried to write a message to it, and now there should be no problems with writing reports again.]




**Outcomes:**
- Successfully completed Dropbox migration to dd@rhs.com for entire department
- Resolved Friday's Cursor error 400 issue (token exhaustion problem)
- Claude subscription for dd account was paid and activated today
- All team members successfully logged out of admin account and into dd account
- GitHub connections configured for all department workers
- Cursor is now fully operational for report writing and AI assistance

### [12.00 - 13.00] - [Directions on resizing cover images for Game Academy]
**What I worked on:**
- Directed Polina Bahun to verify and correct dimensions of images in the 1280x720 folder
- Supervised image resizing process for Game Academy cover images
- Coordinated background extension work to achieve proper rectangular dimensions
- Reviewed completion and provided instructions for file replacement and table updates


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[I gave instructions to Polina Bahun that she should check the dimensions of all images in the 1280x720 folder. Because most of the images in this folder are not 1280x720 in size. And Polina should bring them all to the correct size. These are images that we regenerated in order to make covers for Game Academy from them. And from square generated images, we extended the background to a rectangular size. Despite the fact that they all became rectangular in the folder, nevertheless, the size for most is incorrect. So Polina's task is to fix the dimensions and extend the backgrounds of the images so that their size and aspect ratio are correct for Game Academy covers. Polina has free generations again on her Adobe Firefly for the remainder of her workday before she goes on the project. This was her assignment.

Vilhelm Skrypkar — 10:10
Right now in the 1280x720 folder, all images seem to be rectangular, Marta and I regenerated them, but they're not all actually 1280x720, many have the wrong size, so now you check them and extend them to the correct size
polinnaa._ — 12:30
I checked all of them and changed those that were the wrong size. Should I replace them in that folder and add the links to the table?
Vilhelm Skrypkar — 12:49
They're just with extended backgrounds now, right?
Then replace them in the folder and add them to the table]




**Outcomes:**
- Polina completed verification of all images in 1280x720 folder
- All incorrectly sized images were corrected to proper 1280x720 dimensions
- Background extensions applied where needed to achieve correct aspect ratio
- Files replaced in the folder and links added to the tracking table
- Task completed successfully using Adobe Firefly free generations

### [12.00 - 13.00] - [Choosing mascots for designers professions]
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed mascot designs created by Anastasia Boykova with Yulia Kucherenko
- Evaluated multiple bird mascot options for illustrator profession
- Assessed mascot diversity across different designer professions
- Identified need for more distinctive mascots to avoid visual similarity


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[Yulia Kucherenko and I looked at the mascots that Anastasia Boykova made for the illustrator profession in the design department and came to the conclusion that of all the options, the mascot for illustrators will be the Peacock. Anastasia also made a toucan mascot, and we decided that the toucan will be the mascot for the "interior designer" profession. After that, Yulia and I decided that the bird mascots... For example, the parrot for graphic designers and some kind of blue parrot for 3D designers. They are very similar to each other and we need to make mascots that will be more diverse. Therefore, an additional task appeared for Anastasia Boykova to make new mascots for other designer professions.

]




**Outcomes:**
- Selected Peacock as the official mascot for Illustrators
- Selected Toucan as the official mascot for Interior Designers
- Identified visual similarity problem between graphic designer and 3D designer bird mascots
- Decided to create more diverse and distinctive mascots for remaining professions
- Assigned Anastasia Boykova to develop new mascot options with better visual differentiation


---


### [13.00 - 14.00] - [Assigning new task for mascots]
**What I worked on:**
- Wrote detailed task instructions for Anastasia Boykova based on decisions with Yulia
- Documented requirements for Peacock mascot (Illustrators) including multiple poses and prompts
- Specified Toucan mascot (Interior Designers) development requirements
- Outlined new approach for Graphic Designers mascot to ensure visual distinction
- Defined task for creating new 3D Designers mascot with diverse bird species options


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[After Yulia Kucherenko and I decided that we need to make new mascots for designer professions, I explained this to Anastasia Boykova in text form. I wrote an example of what now needs to be done in the comments to the task. Namely, that we chose the Peacock as the mascot of illustrators. For it, we need to make several other images with this same Peacock in different poses. Create a prompt and description for it in Figma like other mascots. I explained that we chose the toucan as the mascot for interior designers. And for it too, we need to make other angles, prompt and description. I explained that the mascot of graphic designers, the parrot, is too similar to other birds. And Anastasia will need to generate, collect and propose ideas for other parrots with emphasis on the fact that we will choose a parrot that looks least like other birds, that differs most from them. And also the old mascot of 3D designers, which was also a blue parrot. We deleted it and now she needs to come up with several variants of different birds, which Yulia Kucherenko and I will choose tomorrow.

"We chose the peacock for the mascot of illustrators. create a few more images and poses for that exact peacock, then the prompt and description like descriptions of other mascots in other figma sections. Upload the images and the prompt into the mascot's folder on drive

We chose the toucan for the mascot of interior designers. It replaces the old blue parrot mascot because old one resembled other mascots too much. Now create a few more images and poses for the toucan, then the prompt and description like descriptions of other mascots in other figma sections Upload the images and the prompt into the mascot's folder on drive

We're removing the old parrot mascot for graphics designers because it resembled other birds too much. Create another parrot mascot for graphic designers. Create several options for different kinds of parrots and cockateels so itlooks the most distinctive from other mascots.

We're removing the old mascot for 3D designers because it also resembled other birds too much. Create several options for it, make them be different species of birds. The goal, again, is to make this mascot visually distinct from other professions' mascots."

### [15.00 - 18.00] - [Creating the portrait of Azar Imranov]
**What I worked on:**
- Created professional portrait of Azar Imranov
- Implemented dual-format requirements: 1000x1000 frame for CRM with extended PNG inside
- Ensured portrait composition extends to mid-chest or waist level for videographer needs
- Prepared portrait for both CRM upload and video interview usage


**Whisper Flow Transcript:**


[Today I also managed to create a portrait of Azar Imranov. While creating the portrait, I paid attention to the fact that in Figma, the frames in which portrait images are displayed have a size of 1000x1000, and we need this size of portraits for uploading to CRM, and at the same time inside this frame, the image in PNG format should be much larger, especially taller. The portrait should be to the middle of the chest or even to the waist. This is needed for videographers to create video interviews. Therefore, Azar Imranov's portrait in the 1000x1000 frame looks like it's to the shoulders, but in reality, inside the frame hides an image to the waist.

]




**Outcomes:**
- Completed Azar Imranov's portrait with proper technical specifications
- Portrait displayed in 1000x1000 Figma frame (suitable for CRM upload)
- Actual PNG image extends to waist level inside the frame (hidden beyond visible boundaries)
- Format optimized for videographer use in video interview production
- Portrait uploaded and documented in tracking spreadsheet
