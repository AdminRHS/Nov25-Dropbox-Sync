4. Evaluate style match: mascot appearance, colors, typography, layout
5. Document any discrepancies or areas needing improvement
6. Refine prompts if necessary to better match the original style
7. Create final testing report with recommendations

### Instructions:

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Use the master prompt created in the ChatGPT dialogue

5. For each generation, check:
   - Mascot matches 3D Pixar style and brand guidelines
   - Colors match UI kit (primary, secondary, auxiliary)
   - Typography matches specified fonts
   - Layout is consistent with approved posts
   - Overall composition is professional and on-brand

**Quality Criteria:**
- 90%+ visual similarity to approved posts

- Background and composition are appropriate

**If Tests Fail:**
- Identify specific elements that don't match (mascot details, colors, layout, etc.)

- Add more detailed specifications to Design Guidelines
- Test again until quality threshold is met

**Decision Point:**
- If system works: Prepare handoff to designer for training lead generators
