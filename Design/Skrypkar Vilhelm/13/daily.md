## Activities

### [09.00 - 11.00] - [Interview with candidates]
**What I worked on:**
- Conducted interviews with three UI/UX designer candidates together with Yulia Pucherenko
- Evaluated candidates based on their willingness to work with AI and adapt to our workflow
- Assessed technical skills including social media post creation and After Effects animation

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[At the beginning of the day, Yulia Pucherenko and I interviewed three candidates for the position of new UI/UX designers. During the interview process, one candidate left the call on her own. Another refused to work with artificial intelligence as intensively as we do, and we gave the green light to hire the third one because she agreed to change, grow and develop with us. She also had experience creating social media posts and animations in After Effects]

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully hired 1 new UI/UX designer who is willing to adapt and work with AI
- Candidate has valuable experience in social media post creation and After Effects animation
- Two candidates were not suitable: one dropped out voluntarily, another was not open to intensive AI workflow

### [11.00 - 12.00] - [Checking the Graphics for Game Academy covers]
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed course cover graphics for Game Academy with Yulia Kucherenko
- Graphics were created and resized by Polina Bagun and Marta Veretino
- Identified design flaws and inconsistencies in the covers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Next, Yulia Kucherenko and I checked the graphics for the Academy course covers, which were made and then resized by Polina Bagun and Marta Veretino. We mainly found flaws with Yulia outside the scene. On several covers, some of them were not informative, and on others there were incorrect icons of tools for the courses for which these covers were made. Therefore, Polina Bagun received edits and comments on her task in Notion to redo these images

**Outcomes:**
- Identified several covers with non-informative designs
- Found incorrect tool icons on multiple covers
- Provided detailed feedback and revision comments to Polina Bagun in Notion
- Polina Bagun assigned to revise the images based on feedback

### [12.00 - 13.00] - [Giving the quick tutorial on graphics for Discord announcements]
**What I worked on:**
- Tutored Daria Eliseeva on generating graphics for Discord announcements
- Showed her how to use ChatGPT to generate images with company mascot (Goat)
- Provided guidance on prompt engineering for better image generation

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Daria Eliseeva came in. Daria told me that she received a task to make an announcement about flexible working hours on our work Discord server and will create an illustrative image for it. She made an image. It wasn't very colorful in artificial intelligence and she was directed to designers, namely to me, so that I could teach her how to generate images better. I showed her where the mascot is located, which needs to be inserted into the graphics, and explained that in the prompt you need to ask ChatGPT to generate an image that matches the drawing style of the mascot and the theme of the post for which this image is needed. Here is a recording of my brief training.

The prompt says it's a Goat in 3D Pixar style, so it draws the image, and the rest, and the background in the same style.
And there she has the prompt, and the Goat is drawn, and anyway... I can show the screen
How does it work? Yes, you tell it: "Draw me a picture, square, probably. Draw me a picture that is for a Flexible Hours announcement, and with some appropriate activity for it." And the surroundings in the picture also correspond to the theme of the post. That's how you write it to ChatGPT, and it will generate something suitable. Thanks. You're welcome. Let's go.

After that, Daria Eliseeva generated an image with the Goat mascot. The image turned out in principle in that style, only the background was somewhat simplistic and empty. But the image was approved for her, and I additionally told Daria in text form that she needs to ask ChatGPT to also make the background for the images appropriate for the mascot's habitat. Future images she should ideally generate even more beautifully than today's

What do you think?
Image
Well, also write "make the surroundings of the goat appropriate for her natural habitat and reflecting the topic of the picture"
It will probably draw a beautiful background with mountains

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully trained Daria Eliseeva on AI image generation for Discord announcements
- Taught her prompt engineering basics: include mascot style (3D Pixar Goat) and post topic
- Daria generated an approved image, though background was simplistic
- Provided additional guidance to improve future generations: add natural habitat context to prompts
- Expected improvement in quality of future generated images

### [14.00 - 18.00] - [Preparing materials for teaching leadgens to generate posts for RE social media]
**What I worked on:**
- Created comprehensive training materials for lead generators to create Remote Employee social media posts
- Developed universal documentation enabling non-designers to generate consistent, quality graphics
- Built complete design system including mascot prompts, UI kit, and design guidelines using ChatGPT

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Anastasia Kovalskaya told me that Elza and Leadgens received a task that lead generators will write social posts about vacancies at Remote Employee. And about Remote Employees in general. They will also generate images for these posts. And therefore leadgens will be directed to our department so that designers can teach them to generate images. Kovalskaya said that this should be done with our available designer Eleanor, Irina, Polina or Nastya Bykova. But they will be available only tomorrow. Meanwhile, today I showed Kovalskaya what graphics we made for Remote Employees before and said that in principle, in the same style, it can continue to be made for social networks. Which she agreed with. And the rest of the working day I prepared materials for future training and to create some universal documentation that can be given to artificial intelligence so that even in the hands of non-professional designers it would generate images in the same style and quality as were in Remote Employees social networks before. I collected suitable reference images only with the Remote Employees mascot and created a folder on the drive especially for this mascot. I uploaded the reference images. Then in a new dialogue with ChatGPT I gave it these references and asked it to create a prompt for recreating this character in generative artificial intelligence. When I got the prompt, I also collected already made, approved and posted on Instagram Remote Employees images of posts with vacancies and also other posts about Remote Employees. I gave ChatGPT these images in the same dialogue where I was creating the prompt for Moscow. And asked it to create a UI kit and design guidelines for creating these posts. ChatGPT gave me one large text. I made some edits, named the correct font for headings. One of the colors was moved to auxiliary and I asked it to divide the texts into UI kit and Design Guidelines. After that, I asked artificial intelligence to generate a prompt that future employees could give to AI, together with reference images and together with Design Guidelines and UI kit, and get images for posts in the same style as already exists on Remote Employees. ChatGPT gave me this prompt and also some instructions for it. I saved all this on the drive, and now tomorrow it will be possible to test how similar the images will actually turn out. And also give the task to designers to train. Lead generators. If the images turn out to be dissimilar, then either I should finish these prompts and detail them to bring the graphics closer to the original. Or this task will be received by designers who will be available tomorrow
