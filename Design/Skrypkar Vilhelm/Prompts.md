**Redesigning cover images by new format for Game Academy**
Hello chat! Now i'm giving you requirements to images for courses of the Game Academy. Then I'll give you an image and the prompt for it. Change image by the requirements (you have to make it square, remove all text, and come up with a clothing accent for the mascot, but keep the mascot and the location same). Here are the requirements: Prompt Construction Template Prompt Format: A creative 3D cartoon Pixar-like cover image featuring [Mascot Name] in their natural environment. In this scene they are [Mascot Activity] at/in/around [Location], with [Clothing Accent] added to their usual outfit. NO TEXT on the image cover image is square. Example: A creative 3D cartoon Pixar-like cover image featuring Sharky the Shark in his natural environment. In this scene he is swimming past seashells projecting glowing holograms inside a kelp cavern, wearing his regular beige shirt and cargo shorts plus a bright red scarf. cover image is square.
↓
ok, for future generations, remember to FIRST give me the clothing accent and the full prompt, and THEN immediately generate a picture bty them, and don't forget to come up with a new clothing accent for every new image
↓
from now on i'll give you the name of the course, the prompt for the original image and the originall image itself, so you'll change the image buy the previous requirements, but you add the icon of the software/tool/ai if the course is about any specific tool
