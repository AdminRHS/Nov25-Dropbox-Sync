**For creating courses on advanced prompting in different AIs via deep research in Gemini:**
'Hey! I create a learning course for employees on advanced prompting in different AIs. Each lesson of the course must teach advanced prompting in another AI. Please conduct deep research on courses, tutorials, videos, etc around the internet and compile lessons on that AI. Make the theoretical part really short, and focus on possible use cases and details on how to tailor prompts and make that AI work. Now, compile a lesson "Advanced Pompting in [AI name]" '


**For creating full course on an AI (GenSpark) via deep research in Gemini**
'Hey! I create a learning course for employees on working in GenSpark.

**Redesigning cover images by new format for Game Academy**
Hello chat! Now i'm giving you requirements to images for courses of the Game Academy. Then I'll give you an image and the prompt for it. Change image by the requirements (you have to make it square, remove all text, and come up with a clothing accent for the mascot, but keep the mascot and the location same). Here are the requirements: Prompt Construction Template Prompt Format: A creative 3D cartoon Pixar-like cover image featuring [Mascot Name] in their natural environment. In this scene they are [Mascot Activity] at/in/around [Location], with [Clothing Accent] added to their usual outfit. NO TEXT on the image cover image is square. Example: A creative 3D cartoon Pixar-like cover image featuring Sharky the Shark in his natural environment. In this scene he is swimming past seashells projecting glowing holograms inside a kelp cavern, wearing his regular beige shirt and cargo shorts plus a bright red scarf. cover image is square.
↓
ok, for future generations, remember to FIRST give me the clothing accent and the full prompt, and THEN immediately generate a picture bty them, and don't forget to come up with a new clothing accent for every new image
↓
from now on i'll give you the name of the course, the prompt for the original image and the originall image itself, so you'll change the image buy the previous requirements, but you add the icon of the software/tool/ai if the course is about any specific tool

Там куплен Pro план, а на аккаунте admin@rh-s.com куплен Max план. I need the same nicely formatted text of the announcement for all three chats, and three pictures. On each pictures there has to be the maskot (shark for common, hummingbird for design, and chameleon for videographers) in their natural habitat, the icon of Claude AI, and text "Subscribtions Added", all nicely incorporated into whats's going on on the picture. What's going on on the picture has to correspond the announcement of new subscriptions. Aspect ratio of images is 16:9. I'll give you materials for mascots, and then you generate
↓
hey, one image has to have the shark, another the hummingbird, and the third the chameleon. and here's the claude logo

**Creating a prompt, UI kit, design guidelines, instruction for creating social media graphics for REM-s**
https://chatgpt.com/share/e/69160177-7828-8002-8c76-1da539186b59
Hello chat! i'm a graphic designer. I need the prompt for recreating this mascot in generative AI
↓
this prompt has to be used during creation of bigger graphics, so avoid using phrazing like "Create a cute..." or "The mascot should look...". Use this example of the prompt. And i want the generated images to be versatile so avoid including objects that the mascot holds as they will be generated over and over again
↓
Now please analyze these social media graphics and create a universal UI kit and design guidelines for this brand so I can create new graphics of the same stylistics by giving AI them and those reference graphics
↓
move Light Peach / Light Beige (#F5C6A5) to secondary colors the main titles font is Sofia Sans Condensed separate UI kit and the design guides
↓
Greate! And now give me the prompt, so I will provide an AI with the prompt, the UI kit and the design guidelines, the reference pictures, then I will give it the new post theme, title or other detailes - and AI will generate the graphics like those examples
↓
in the prompt: - leave placeholders for the main titles and the rest of design elements that the graphics has to have - accentuate the "full-time/part-time, language, location, etc" are only for example and don't have to be on the image unless directly specified - give directions to create more picturesque background, like on these references
↓
look at the generated image. another chat put texts from placeholders on it. accentuate in this updated prompt that it puts stuff from placeholders only if user explicitly fills them, otherwise it doesn't
↓
Good. I want to turn it into a comprehensive instruction for employees who are not designers and will have to generate that graphics having only topic (or some extra reuirements) of the post and access to the folder containing the mascot references, posts references, prompt, ui kit, and design guidelines. Please write to them what to upload to the AI (chatgpt), which prompt to use, how to add extra requirements (if they have any), and how to prompt the AI in the continuation of the dialog if they want to add some leements or change something on the graphics
↓
add that they have to add the masctot prompt file too
