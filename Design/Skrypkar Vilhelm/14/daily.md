## Activities

### [09.00 - 10.00] - [First stage of checking convenient-brands test task]
**What I worked on:**
- Conducted first stage review of Convenient Brands test tasks with Yulia Kucherenko
- All designers submitted their work for evaluation

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Today at the beginning of the day, Yulia Kucherenko and I conducted the first stage of checking the test task for Convenient Brands, which all the designers made. Yulia Kucherenko gave them a number of corrections. And also we explained to them which folders on the drive to upload and where on GitHub.

### [10.00 - 12.00] - [Creating instruction on creating graphics for announcements in Discord]
**What I worked on:**
- Formalized yesterday's verbal Discord graphics tutorial into comprehensive written documentation
- Used ChatGPT to expand and structure the instructions
- Created universal process for selecting appropriate mascots for different announcement types

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[From yesterday's short instruction that I gave to Daria Eliseeva in oral form, I made a slightly more detailed one with the help of ChatGPT. In it, for universality, I indicated that you need to give the artificial intelligence the theme of the announcement and also give it a mascot suitable for this announcement, and also the instruction includes a link to the folder in which to search and select the mascot

### [12.00 - 14.00] - [Helping put AI catalogue in production]
**What I worked on:**
- Coordinated with Nikolay Artemchuk and Daria Eliseeva on company AI tools catalogue
- Located the designer who created the latest version and brought them into the project
- Facilitated collaboration between Eleanor Safonova (designer) and developers
- Helped coordinate GitHub upload and page interactivity development

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[I was pulled into a chat with Nikolay Artemchuk and Daria Eliseeva, where they were making a catalogue of artificial intelligences that our company uses. Artemchuk had an old version of the catalogue page, and also he and Eliseeva had an Excel table with current artificial intelligences that we use. They pulled me in to find out which of the designers made the latest version of the online catalogue. And we found and pulled into this same chat Eleanor Safonova, and Eleanor with the developers was engaged in uploading to GitHub... the latest version of the catalogue page that Eleanor made. And then... the developer worked on the interactivity of this page and everyone in the chat worked on editing the online tools cards. And expressed their wishes that the list of tools would be pulled from the Excel table of current tools.
]

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully identified Eleanor Safonova as creator of latest catalogue design
- Eleanor joined the project and uploaded latest catalogue version to GitHub
- Developer implemented page interactivity features
- Team collaboratively edited online tool cards for accuracy
- Discussed integration between Excel table and catalogue display for automatic updates
- AI catalogue moved closer to production-ready state

### [14.00 - 16.00] - [Second stage of checking designer's test tasks and working tools]
**What I worked on:**
- Verified designers' tool installations (Cursor, Claude extension, VS Code, Dropbox) per Nikokar's request
- Helped designers access correct Dropbox root folder instead of report folders
- Assisted designers in uploading test tasks to Google Drive
- Learned how to launch HTML pages from GitHub and created video tutorial
- Helped designers fix their GitHub repositories

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Nikokar first came into the admin chat to check (for subsequent work with taxonomy) whether we have Cursor, Claude extension for Cursor, VS Code and Dropbox installed, and whether we work in Cursor and VS Code with the company's Dropbox. After that, he gave me instructions to go to the designer chat and check the same with them. I checked with the designers, helped a couple of them get into the root Dropbox folder instead of report folders, but in general all the software was installed. Also, Anastasia Kovalskaya came into the chat. And besides, the time to submit the test task was approaching. So I helped the designers upload their test task to their Google Drive folders. They also showed it to me on GitHub, and with the help of the designers I figured out how to launch an HTML page from GitHub because the test task for email newsletter for Convenient Brands they made in HTML. After figuring out how to launch it, I recorded a very short video instruction about the sequence of clicks on GitHub to launch pages and sent it to Anastasia Kovalskaya. Now uninformed people will have the opportunity to view HTML pages on GitHub. I also gave some instructions to a couple of designers on how to make their repository on GitHub functional, where they uploaded their work. GitHubs are part of the materials and are in the folders of completed test tasks

**Outcomes:**
- Verified all designers have required tools installed: Cursor, Claude extension, VS Code, Dropbox
- Helped some designers navigate to correct Dropbox root folder
- All designers successfully uploaded test tasks to Google Drive
- Learned GitHub HTML page launching process from designers
- Created video tutorial on how to launch HTML pages from GitHub
- Shared video with Anastasia Kovalskaya - now non-technical people can view HTML pages on GitHub
- Helped multiple designers fix their GitHub repositories
- GitHub links now included in test task submission materials

### [16.00 - 18.00] - [Refining Remote Employee social media instruction and prompt]
**What I worked on:**
- Refined and finalized instruction and prompt for training lead generators on Remote Employee social media post generation
- Tested ChatGPT image generation with yesterday's prompt
- Improved prompt with more placeholders and anti-placeholder instructions
- Converted technical prompt into user-friendly instruction for non-designers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[The remaining part of the working day I refined the instruction and prompt for subsequent training of lead generators and other employees of non-design professions on how to generate posts for Remote Employees social networks. I tested how well ChatGPT generates images according to the prompt compiled yesterday, asked ChatGPT to add more placeholders for possible elements. I checked again how the image is generated, then gave ChatGPT instructions to emphasize that if a person did not specify additional elements in the prompt, then placeholders should not... appear as placeholders on the graphic. After the result satisfied me, I asked ChatGPT to turn the prompt into an instruction for people of non-design professions. The instruction teaches them... what prompt to give, what materials to upload, namely the prompt for graphics generation, mascot prompt, mascot references, references of social media posts that were made earlier, UI-Kit of graphics for Remote Employees social networks and Design Guidelines for creating graphics. Also, this instruction teaches how to specify additional elements if an employee needs them on the graphic and also teaches how, in continuation of the dialogue with artificial intelligence, to ask it to change or add something to the image if they see that it is necessary based on the results of the first generation. I think that now you can test the instruction and prompt on lead generators and this task will be received by one of the designers on Monday. Work together with lead generators, see how their graphics will turn out and if necessary add something to the instruction or prompt

- Instruction covers: what prompt to use, which materials to upload (graphics prompt, mascot prompt, mascot references, previous post references, UI-Kit, Design Guidelines)
- Included guidance on how to specify additional elements and request changes in follow-up dialogue
- System ready for testing with lead generators
- Task prepared for designer handoff on Monday to train lead generators
- Designer will observe lead generator results and refine instruction/prompt as needed
