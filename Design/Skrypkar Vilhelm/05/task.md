## Task 1: Continue generating course cover images with updated workflow

### Steps:
1. Open the ChatGPT session and ensure it's aware of the generation requirements (no text, icons included, clothing accent first)
2. For each remaining course, provide three inputs: course name, reference image, and previous prompt
3. Review the generated image to ensure tool/program icon is harmoniously integrated
4. Verify image meets quality standards (no text, proper composition, appropriate icon)
5. Save the approved image to the course covers folder on Google Drive
6. Document the prompt and clothing accent for future reference
7. Move to the next course and repeat the process

### Instructions:

Use the improved three-input workflow for all remaining course covers. Start each generation by providing ChatGPT with:
1. The specific course name (e.g., "General Information", "Unity Basics", etc.)
2. The reference image from the previous course or style guide
3. The prompt that was used for the previous version

This ensures that ChatGPT understands which tool icon to integrate into the image. Always verify that the generated image:
- Has NO text overlays
- Includes the appropriate tool/program icon for that specific course
- Features harmonious composition with the icon naturally integrated
- Maintains consistent style with other course covers

If ChatGPT forgets the requirements or generates poor quality images, remind it of the specific requirements before proceeding.

## Task 2: Monitor and refine ChatGPT generation consistency

### Steps:
1. At the start of each work session, review the master prompts with ChatGPT
2. Clearly state all requirements: no text, clothing accent first, then prompt, then image generation
3. Test with one course cover generation to verify ChatGPT remembers the workflow
4. If quality issues arise, immediately provide specific feedback and examples
5. Document any recurring issues or patterns in generation quality
6. Adjust the master prompts if consistent issues are identified
7. Create a checklist of requirements to reference during each session

3. **Quality Control**: After each generation, verify all requirements are met before approving
4. **Feedback Loop**: If ChatGPT deviates from requirements, immediately provide corrective feedback with specific examples of what needs to change
5. **Documentation**: Keep notes on any recurring issues to identify patterns and update master prompts accordingly

### Instructions:

Create comprehensive documentation that includes:

**Workflow Overview**:
- Purpose: Generate professional course covers with integrated tool icons
- Three inputs required: course name + reference image + previous prompt
- Output: Course cover with harmoniously integrated tool icon

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. Identify the course that needs a cover
2. Gather the three inputs (course name, reference, previous prompt)
3. Provide all three inputs to ChatGPT
4. Receive clothing accent description and prompt
5. Review and approve the prompt
6. Receive the generated image
7. Quality check the image against requirements
8. Save and document the approved image

**Quality Standards**:
- No text overlays
- Tool/program icon clearly visible and naturally integrated
- Consistent style with other course covers
- Appropriate for the course content

**Common Issues and Solutions**:
- ChatGPT adds text: Remind it that images should have no text
- Icon not integrated: Ensure course name is provided in the input
- Inconsistent style: Always provide reference image from previous generations

## Task 4: Review and optimize master prompts further

### Steps:
1. Analyze recent generation results to identify areas for improvement
2. Review the current master prompts in the course lesson
3. Identify specific phrases or instructions that could be clearer
4. Test revised prompts with 2-3 course cover generations
5. Compare results with previous generations
6. Refine based on test results
7. Update the master prompts in the course lesson
8. Document the changes and rationale
