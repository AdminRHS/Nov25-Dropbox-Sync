## Activities

### [09.00 - 10.30] - [Reports statistics discussion]
**What I worked on:**
- Analyzing report completion statistics in the design department admin chat
- Discussing report completion requirements for different types of designers

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

At the beginning of the work day, we in the design department administration chat discussed and analyzed in verbal form the statistics of report completion, which were posted yesterday in the Admin Reports chat. We came to the conclusion that all designers working on RX projects are filling out reports more or less well, but those who work exclusively on client projects should not be bothered with these statistics and should not be shown this chat at all, because they don't need to fill out reports in such detail.

**Outcomes:**
- Decided that RX designers are completing reports adequately
- Agreed not to require detailed reports from designers working exclusively on client projects
- Decided to keep the Admin Reports chat hidden from client-only designers

### [11.30 - 18.00] - [Creating pictures for cover images of Game Academy courses]
**What I worked on:**
- Generating cover images for Game Academy courses
- Improving the generation process by adding tool/program icons to the images
- Updating master prompts in the course lesson about generating thumbnails
- Troubleshooting ChatGPT generation issues

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

The rest of the work day I spent generating images for redesigning Game Academy course covers. After several generations, I came to the conclusion and noticed that the images look somewhat empty and incomplete without the icon of the tool or program or artificial intelligence that a particular course teaches. Therefore, I instructed ChatGPT to add course icons, tool icons that the course teaches, to the course image. And also after this, I started giving ChatGPT not only the prompt of the previous version of the image and the image itself as a reference, but also the name of the course to which this image belongs, so that ChatGPT would draw on it the icon of the tool that this course teaches. And also as a result of this, after ChatGPT started drawing more beautiful images with harmoniously integrated icons, I changed the text of the course lesson dedicated to generating and creating covers for the course. I changed it using another new dialogue with ChatGPT in which I asked it to change the master prompts for generating new course images or adding new images to an existing set. ChatGPT made changes to the paragraphs dedicated to what should be in the image as a result of its generation. And now, the master prompts that the course lesson text refers to for generating images have been updated.

I spent the entire rest of the day generating images, now with icons. But closer to the end of the day, ChatGPT forgot again that images need to be generated without text, that it needs to give me first the character's clothing accent and the prompt, and only then generate the image. And in general, it generated them quite poorly. I reminded it several times until it gave me an image for the next course called General Information in the form it should be. And then I struggled with ChatGPT to get it to give me the clothing accent and prompt. I did get the clothing accent and prompt, and the image in the right format, but I hope that this chat fatigue only happened today, and tomorrow it will work normally again and generate prompts and images on the first try.

**Outcomes:**
- Successfully identified that course images need tool/program icons to look complete
- Updated the generation workflow to include course names for better icon integration
- Updated master prompts in the course lesson about thumbnail generation
- Generated multiple course cover images with integrated tool icons
- Encountered and worked through ChatGPT generation quality issues towards the end of day
- Successfully completed the General Information course image despite challenges

## Notes
- Discovered that course cover images need tool/program icons to look complete and professional
- Updated the generation workflow to be more comprehensive (includes course name + reference image + previous prompt)
- Master prompts in the thumbnail generation course have been updated to reflect best practices
- Need to monitor ChatGPT generation quality - experienced issues with consistency towards end of day

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
