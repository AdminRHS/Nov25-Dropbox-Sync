## Task 1: Finish Academy course covers

### Owner: Vilhelm (primary), Polina (support)
### Deadline: 2025-11-08 EOD

### Steps:
1. Collect all source images and check the course spreadsheet for which covers are pending.
2. For each pending image, open in the editor (Photoshop / Photopea / Affinity / GIMP) or an AI editing tool.
3. Resize canvas to 1280×720. Place original square artwork so the main subject is shifted to the right side of the frame.
4. Fill the left side with a neutral/empty background — either solid color or generative fill matching the existing image's style. Ensure the left area is visually empty (no distracting elements).
5. Export images as high-quality JPG or PNG, named using the course code or sheet row ID.
6. Upload exports to the Drive folder and mark status in the course spreadsheet.

### Resources and Links:
- Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GW3oWAwGlgRtsplhBFNBI8VGtQ-n9lG_&usp=drive_fs
- Course spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ev_tOOysOAyC6zhmBINmZTjYYTppeKr4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114579329951199111949&rtpof=true&sd=true

### Instructions:
- Use a non-destructive workflow (duplicate layers, keep originals).
- If using generative fill, use a mask for the left area and instruct the tool to generate a neutral/background-only fill (no new objects).
- Keep final images consistent in style and color temperature with existing covers.

## Task 2: Research AI methods for resizing and background fill

### Owner: Polina
### Deadline: 2025-11-09 midday

### Steps:
1. Create a new tab in the AI Research spreadsheet and name it "Resize & Fill - 2025-11-07".
2. Compile a list of candidate tools and services (Adobe Firefly, Runway, Stable Diffusion img2img/inpainting, DALL·E edit, Photoshop Generative Fill, ClipDrop, Upscale services with inpainting, etc.).
3. For each tool, note: cost (free/paid), ease of automation (API or manual), best use-case, speed, and a short pros/cons line.
4. Run quick tests (1–2 images per tool) using a representative square image: generate a 1280×720 version with subject shifted right and neutral left fill.
5. Upload test outputs to Drive and add links/thumbnails to the spreadsheet with short notes on quality, time, and cost.

### Resources and Links:
- Notion research brief: https://www.notion.so/rh-s/Find-methods-of-changing-image-size-deliberately-using-AI-2a4b16a3145180d28425dc71ca55521b?source=copy_link
- AI Research spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19RuENLCI7Urz_trUW3V5KnIN_joO45-2bH_mTwENk30/edit?gid=1561813207#gid=1561813207&range=1:1

### Instructions:
- Prioritize tools that allow masking + inpainting or img2img with good edge preservation.
- Capture exact prompts/settings used for reproducibility.
- Add a recommendation at the top of the new tab: pick the primary workflow (fastest + best quality) and a fallback.

## Task 3: Finalize and post Claude subscription announcement

### Owner: Vilhelm
### Deadline: 2025-11-08 morning

### Steps:
1. Regenerate the chameleon announcement image using the correct mascot asset and the correct Claude logo. Ensure aspect ratio 16:9.
2. Remove the unrelated/extra duck image from the generation results and do not use it.
3. Confirm all three images (shark, hummingbird, chameleon) have consistent style, correct Claude icon, and contain the text "Subscriptions Added" in English.
4. Finalize and format the announcement text (English) for the three channels.
5. Post the announcement to three channels: Global News, Design chat, Video main news, attaching the respective image for each channel.
6. Note the post times and save a short confirmation in the spreadsheet or project log.

### Resources and Links:
- ChatGPT generation conversation: https://chatgpt.com/c/690dc7ab-b970-832b-9c7d-501c7f4f1e73

### Instructions:
- When regenerating images, provide the correct mascot asset files and the accurate Claude logo as image references.
- If ChatGPT/assistant continues to produce incorrect logos, switch to an image editor to place the correct logo manually.
- Keep copies of final images in the Drive folder and record filenames in the course spreadsheet or announcements log.

## Task 4: Audit generated images and quality control

### Owner: Vilhelm / design team
### Deadline: 2025-11-08 EOD

### Steps:
1. Review all generated and edited images for Academy covers and announcement images.
2. Check for correct dimensions, correct mascot/logo appearance, consistent color grading, and lack of unintended elements.
3. Flag any images needing rework and add short notes on required fixes.
4. Schedule or assign rework tasks and update `task.md` statuses.

### Resources and Links:
- Drive folder and spreadsheets (links above)

### Instructions:
- Use the spreadsheet to track image status: Pending / In Progress / Needs Rework / Done.
- For subtle style mismatches, prefer manual color correction over wholesale regeneration.

## Reminder
- Break each plan item into steps and update statuses.
- Add example outputs to the AI Research tab for future reference.
