## Activities

### [09:00 - 10:00] - Assigning task to find AI/tools for resizing and filling images
**What I worked on:**
- Assigned Polina Bahun to research AI tools and other methods for resizing and filling images so they match the Academy cover requirements (1280×720, focal content on the right, empty/neutral background on the left).
- Explained that Polina ran out of free Adobe Firefly credits and that we only have paid Firefly on two machines (one is mine). Asked her to find alternative AI services and traditional techniques to reliably change image aspect ratio, shift artwork to the right and generate a neutral left fill.
- Asked Polina to document findings in a new tab of our existing "AI Research" spreadsheet and Notion page.

**Whisper Flow Transcript (translated):**

"At the start of the day Polina Bahun said she made several course cover images. She made them at the required size 1280×720 with a nice focal area on the right and empty background on the left. She ran out of free generations in Adobe Firefly. Polina does not have a paid Firefly subscription; our company only has subscriptions on two machines, one of which is mine. Therefore I decided to give Polina the task of searching for other AIs or methods — including traditional tools combined with AI — to change image sizes and fill areas on demand. For example, we currently need to take square images generated by ChatGPT and make them 1280×720, shifting the generated art to the right and filling the left part with an empty background. The filled area must be empty/neutral. These are current requirements, but in the future we may need other kinds of edits — different shifts and different fills. So Polina must find AI tools or methods that allow resizing and customizable fills. Polina should find them and add them into a new tab in the AI Research table we already have."

**Outcomes:**
- Task assigned to Polina to research and document potential AI tools and workflows.
- New tab requested in the AI Research spreadsheet / Notion to collect methods, links, costs, and example results.

### [10:00 - 11:00] - Creating announcements about new Claude subscriptions
**What I worked on:**
- Prepared announcement text and images about newly purchased Claude subscriptions on additional accounts.
- Used ChatGPT to draft the announcement text in English and to generate three announcement images (16:9) with mascots for each audience: shark (common), hummingbird (design), and chameleon (videographers). Provided mascot assets and Claude icon and iterated on generations.

**Whisper Flow Transcript (translated):**

"Earlier in the morning, Mykola Artemchuk asked me to create texts and images for announcements that new Claude subscriptions were purchased. Previously we had a paid plan only on admin@rh-s.com. Now subscriptions were additionally purchased on dd@rh-s.com and contact@fv-e.com. The admin account has the Max plan. Artemchuk dictated what should be in the announcement. The announcement text should be the same across channels and posted to three channels: Global News, Design chat, and Video main news. The Max plan on admin@rh-s.com is relevant to everyone. The paid Claude on dd@rh-s.com is primarily for designers for Dropbox file processing and reporting; videographers will use the paid Claude from contact@fv-e.com with Cursor. I sent what Artemchuk told me to ChatGPT:

"Hey chat! I'm a designer and got an assignment to create an announcement post. I need an announcement for Global News, Design chat and Video main news that, in addition to the paid subscription on admin@rh-s.com, Claude has been purchased on dd@rh-s.com and contact@fv-e.com. They have Pro plans, and admin@rh-s.com has a Max plan. I need the same nicely formatted announcement text for all three chats, and three pictures. On each picture must be the mascot (shark for common, hummingbird for design, and chameleon for videographers) in their natural habitat, the Claude AI icon, and text "Subscriptions Added", all incorporated to reflect the announcement. Aspect ratio 16:9. I'll give you mascot materials and then you generate."

ChatGPT turned this into a formatted English announcement and started generating images once I provided the three mascots (shark, hummingbird, chameleon). At first, ChatGPT incorrectly produced three images with the shark and used an invented Claude logo. I provided the correct logo and reminded it that each image needs a different mascot. It then generated good images for the shark and hummingbird. ChatGPT also produced an unrelated extra image with a duck (and text) which I did not request. The fourth image included a chameleon mascot that looked off, so I asked to regenerate image #4. Note: ChatGPT on the admin account was misbehaving and required multiple regenerations to get acceptable results.

**Outcomes:**
- Announcement text drafted in English and saved.
- Initial set of images generated; two are acceptable (shark, hummingbird), one needs re-generation and one extra unrelated image needs removal.
- Next steps: regenerate the chameleon image with correct mascot style and correct Claude logo; finalize three images and post the announcement to the three channels.

### [11:00 - 18:00] - Creating cover images for courses (editing/generated squares → 1280×720 covers)
**What I worked on:**
- Spent the rest of the day editing square images previously generated for Academy courses, converting them into correct cover images (1280×720) with the focal area on the right and an empty/neutral left area.
- Some of the images were originally created by Marta Vereteno and Polina Bahun. Marta now works on client projects; Polina's working hours are morning-only, so I finished many images in the afternoon.

**Whisper Flow Transcript (translated):**

"For the remainder of the day I edited square images previously generated for Academy courses, turning them into properly-sized cover images with the pleasing area on the right and empty area on the left. Some images were created earlier by Marta Vereteno and Polina Bahun, but Marta now focuses on client projects; Polina's day is half-day and the remaining images were finished by me. Not all images are finished yet — remaining images will be completed either by Polina or me the following day to meet Academy requirements."

**Outcomes:**
- Most covers were resized and edited to the Academy format.
- A subset of images remains; those are assigned to Polina or myself for completion the next day.
