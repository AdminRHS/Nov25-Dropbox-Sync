# Daily Plan - November 6, 2025

## Instructions
**What**: Strategic plan for next steps
**Include**:
- Review your daily.md
- Prioritized action items
- Goals and objectives
- Expected outcomes

---

## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Successfully delegated Game Academy cover format conversion to Marta Vereteno (5 hours on her last day of internal task availability)
- Expanded Anastasyia Bykova's mascot library task with two new mascots (Illustrators Dept + Arctic Fox for Recruiters)
- Completed ALL square image generation for Game Academy course covers despite ChatGPT conversation degradation
- Coordinated parallel work across team (Polina Bohun, Marta Vereteno) for efficient project progress
- Encountered and documented severe ChatGPT conversation degradation - conversation has hit limits and should be retired

**Key learnings:**
- ChatGPT conversations have finite useful lifespan - degradation symptoms include incomplete responses, forgotten instructions, non-verbal outputs
- Effective task delegation maximizes team productivity even with limited resource availability
- NotebookLM file format requirements (PDF/MP4, no PNG) constrain mascot library standardization approach
- Organizational evolution requires mascot library updates (Hummingbird promoted to Dept-wide mascot)
- Removing objects from prompts prevents unwanted repetition in AI-generated variations

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Complete Game Academy Cover Image Production Pipeline**
   - Goal: Finalize all course covers in production-ready 1280x720 format
   - Expected outcome: Complete set of covers ready for Game Academy website implementation
   - Deadline: This week (all square images complete, conversion remaining)
   - Dependencies: Marta Vereteno's 5 hours of conversion work + decision on who completes remaining conversions

2. **Retire Degraded ChatGPT Conversation and Establish New Workflow**
   - Goal: Replace exhausted ChatGPT conversation with fresh conversation or alternative approach
   - Expected outcome: Restored ability to generate high-quality AI images with consistent prompts
   - Deadline: Before next image generation task (urgent - blocks future work quality)
   - Action: Either start new ChatGPT conversation with context summary OR explore alternative tools

3. **Review Anastasyia Bykova's Mascot Concept Proposals**
   - Goal: Select final mascot direction for Illustrators Department from her 2-3 concept options
   - Expected outcome: Approved mascot concept ready for finalization and file format exports
   - Deadline: As soon as Anastasyia presents options (likely this week or early next week)
   - Context: Toucan, cuckoo bird, or other colorful bird concepts suggested

### Medium Priority
1. **Establish ChatGPT Conversation Lifecycle Management Guidelines**
   - Goal: Document when conversations should be retired/refreshed to prevent quality degradation
   - Expected outcome: Team guidelines preventing future degradation issues
   - Deadline: Next 1-2 weeks
   - Insight: Two degradation incidents now documented (Nov 4 memory limits, Nov 6 conversation exhaustion)

2. **Verify Marta Vereteno's Format Conversion Quality**
   - Goal: Review her 1280x720 conversions for quality, consistency, and proper specifications
   - Expected outcome: Either approved finals OR clear feedback for adjustments
   - Deadline: Early next week (after her work is complete)
   - Specs to verify: Proper dimensions, seamless background extension, design on right, text space on left

3. **Complete Mascot Library Standardization**
   - Goal: Finalize two new mascots (Illustrators + Arctic Fox) with all required file formats
   - Expected outcome: Mascot library complete with PNG, PDF, MP4 for all mascots including new additions
   - Deadline: End of next week
   - Formats: Transparent PNG, PDF (NotebookLM), MP4 animations (simple, no sound)

4. **Determine Next Phase Assignment for 1280x720 Conversion**
   - Goal: Decide who completes remaining image conversions (self vs. delegate to Polina Bohun)
   - Expected outcome: Clear ownership and timeline for completion
   - Deadline: Tomorrow (to maintain project momentum)
   - Consideration: Polina's availability vs. self-completion efficiency

### Low Priority
1. **Create Mascot Design System Documentation**
   - Goal: Document each mascot's core identity to prevent design drift and cross-contamination
   - Expected outcome: Style guide specifying permanent features, variable elements, color palettes
   - Deadline: Next 2-3 weeks
   - Purpose: Prevent accessories/elements from mixing between mascots in future AI generations

2. **Document Successful Prompt Engineering Techniques**
   - Goal: Capture lessons learned about prompt best practices (remove objects, specify gender/email, etc.)
   - Expected outcome: Reusable guide for team members doing AI image generation
   - Deadline: Next 2-3 weeks
   - Examples: Object removal prevents repetition, gender specification prevents randomness

3. **Plan Game Academy Cover Implementation Handoff**
   - Goal: Prepare deliverables package and coordinate with Game Academy team for website integration
   - Expected outcome: Smooth handoff with usage guidelines, file naming conventions, technical specs
   - Deadline: After all 1280x720 conversions complete
   - Include: Finals, naming docs, text placement recommendations, source files if needed

## Goals and Objectives
- **Immediate**: Complete 1280x720 format conversion for all Game Academy course covers
- **Quality assurance**: Review Marta's conversion work and Anastasyia's mascot concepts
- **Process improvement**: Establish ChatGPT conversation management guidelines to prevent future degradation
- **Resource optimization**: Make strategic decision on task delegation vs. self-completion
- **Knowledge management**: Document prompt engineering best practices and mascot design standards
- **Project completion**: Finalize mascot library expansion with proper file formats for NotebookLM compatibility
- **Team enablement**: Provide clear direction and resources for continued parallel work

## Expected Outcomes
- **By tomorrow**: Decision on who completes remaining 1280x720 conversions; potentially retire old ChatGPT conversation
- **By end of this week**: All Game Academy course covers complete in 1280x720 format; Anastasyia presents mascot concepts for review
- **By end of next week**: Selected mascot finalized and exported in all formats; quality review of Marta's conversion work complete
- **By next 2-3 weeks**: ChatGPT lifecycle guidelines documented; mascot design system documentation created; prompt engineering guide complete
- **Ongoing**: Maintain effective team coordination and task delegation for optimal productivity
- **Long-term**: Established, documented workflows that prevent quality degradation and enable consistent AI-assisted design work
