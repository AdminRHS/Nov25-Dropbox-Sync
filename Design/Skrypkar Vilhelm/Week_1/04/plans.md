## Today's Review
**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Successfully implemented new AI-assisted reporting workflow using Whisper Flow and Cursor
- Generated Game Academy course cover images and identified key technical challenges (ChatGPT memory limits, design cross-contamination)
- Created comprehensive training materials for team (video recordings, refined prompts)
- Effectively delegated tasks to team members (Polina Bohun, Sviatoslav Pokrovsky)
- Developed and refined English-language AI prompt for consistent report processing
- Discovered important workflow optimizations (file path flexibility, Photoshop generative fill for backgrounds)
- Established knowledge transfer process through video documentation

**Key learnings:**
- ChatGPT memory storage limits can significantly impact output quality
- Detailed Whisper Flow transcripts are essential for effective AI report processing
- Video documentation enables efficient knowledge transfer
- Both absolute and relative file paths work for AI processing

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Discuss ChatGPT Memory Management with Yulia Kucherenko**
   - Goal: Resolve ChatGPT memory storage limit issue to maintain image generation quality
   - Expected outcome: Clear strategy for managing ChatGPT memory (delete old memories, start new conversation, or alternative solution)
   - Deadline: Tomorrow morning (urgent - blocking continued image generation)

2. **Complete Remaining Game Academy Course Cover Images**
   - Goal: Finish generating all course covers to meet new 1280x720 specifications
   - Expected outcome: Full set of course covers ready for Photoshop post-processing
   - Deadline: End of week

3. **Post-Process Generated Images in Photoshop**
   - Goal: Use generative fill to extend backgrounds and create final 1280x720 covers with left-side space for text
   - Expected outcome: Production-ready course cover images for Game Academy implementation
   - Deadline: End of week

### Medium Priority
1. **Complete and Share Second Training Video with Designers**
   - Goal: Finalize video editing with Sviatoslav Pokrovsky and distribute to designers
   - Expected outcome: Designers have high-quality reference material for new reporting system
   - Deadline: Tomorrow (pending Sviatoslav's completion)

2. **Monitor Team Adoption of New Reporting System**
   - Goal: Ensure designers understand and correctly implement the Whisper Flow → Cursor AI workflow
   - Expected outcome: Team members successfully filling out daily.md, plans.md, and tasks.md files
   - Deadline: This week (ongoing)

3. **Create Design Guidelines for Game Academy Mascots**
   - Goal: Document each mascot's unique characteristics to prevent design cross-contamination
   - Expected outcome: Reference document specifying each mascot's colors, features, and accessories
   - Deadline: Next week

4. **Document ChatGPT Training Process for Image Generation**
   - Goal: Create reusable guide for training ChatGPT to generate consistent mascot designs
   - Expected outcome: Template that team members can use for future design projects
   - Deadline: Next week

### Low Priority
1. **Optimize AI Reporting Prompt Based on Team Feedback**
   - Goal: Refine the English-language prompt based on real-world usage by team members
   - Expected outcome: Improved prompt that handles edge cases and produces better results
   - Deadline: Next 2 weeks

2. **Explore Alternative AI Image Generation Tools**
   - Goal: Research tools with better memory management and character consistency features
   - Expected outcome: Recommendations for potentially more efficient image generation workflows
   - Deadline: Next 2 weeks

3. **Create Template Library for Common Report Scenarios**
   - Goal: Build example reports for common task types to help team members
   - Expected outcome: Reference library of well-structured daily.md examples
   - Deadline: Next 2 weeks

## Goals and Objectives
- **Immediate**: Resolve ChatGPT memory limitation to unblock course cover generation
- **Short-term**: Complete all Game Academy course covers with proper specifications
- **Process improvement**: Ensure smooth team adoption of new AI-assisted reporting workflow
- **Knowledge management**: Create reusable documentation and training materials for design processes
- **Quality assurance**: Establish design guidelines to maintain mascot consistency
- **Workflow optimization**: Refine AI prompts and processes based on practical experience
- **Team enablement**: Equip team members with tools and knowledge for independent work

## Expected Outcomes
- **By tomorrow**: ChatGPT memory management strategy implemented; second training video shared with designers
- **By end of week**: Complete set of Game Academy course covers (generated + post-processed in Photoshop)
- **By next week**: Design guidelines document and ChatGPT training process documentation completed
- **Ongoing**: Team successfully using new reporting system with minimal issues
- **Long-term**: Established, documented workflows that can be replicated and improved over time
