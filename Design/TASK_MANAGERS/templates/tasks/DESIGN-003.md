  reasoning: Boundary setting requires human negotiation skills. Client expectation
    management needs emotional intelligence. Working hours policy requires business
    judgment. Reporting frequency optimization requires understanding of client needs
    and team capacity. Communication can be templated but delivery requires personal
    touch.
