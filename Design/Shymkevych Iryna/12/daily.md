### [9:00 - 11:00] - [Recreate an employee card and make changes on it]

**Outcomes:**

- As a result, a card version was created that, if desired, can be used as an additional option for the main page.

### [11:00 - 14:00] - [Making changes on the second version page design]
**What I worked on:**
- A dark theme was created for the page, and the cards were modified to match the dark theme. It was important to remove the white background color so the fonts would be legible in the dark theme. Smooth animation was added for an attractive appearance, and a low-light glow was added to blocks and buttons to help them stand out in the dark theme.
