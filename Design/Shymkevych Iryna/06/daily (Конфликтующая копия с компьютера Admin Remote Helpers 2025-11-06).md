## Activities

### [9:00 - 11:30] - [Working on main page design]
**What I worked on:**
- Today, work was done on the website's main page. Due to restrictions on working with Claude, I worked on the code in Gemini. However, due to Gemini crashing, I had to change the code manually. AI sent instructions on how to make the changes. The main work was done on employee cards, changing colors, design, animation, and text.

### [12:30 - 14:00] - [Finding and using a tool that could take the code and recreate the file in Figma]
**What I worked on:**
- Using artificial intelligence, I used several tools that were suggested to me. Several options are not available for free; you can create a file in the AI ​​itself, but you can only download it if you have a paid subscription. However, I found a plugin in Figma itself that can do this for free. Therefore, a new website version and a new employee card version were added to the Figma file.

2. Use AI (Gemini or Claude) to help optimize code structure
3. Follow AI instructions to make manual code changes if tools crash
4. Test all employee card variations for consistency
5. Verify all pop-up windows display and close correctly
6. Check button icons and ensure they match design specifications
7. Test all animations for smooth performance
8. Validate responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop
9. Run performance audit using browser dev tools
10. Fix any identified issues manually or with AI assistance
11. Create final backup of code and upload to repository

- Browser dev tools for testing
- Previous prompts from Google Drive

### Instructions:
Begin by conducting a comprehensive review of the current main page. Open the page in a browser and systematically test every interactive element—click all buttons, open all pop-ups, scroll through all sections. Use your previously created prompts to guide any necessary changes. If using Gemini and it crashes, be prepared to implement changes manually following the AI's instructions. Focus on polish: ensure colors are exactly right, animations are smooth, and the overall experience feels professional. Test on actual mobile devices if possible, not just browser responsive mode. Document any manual fixes made so they can be added to your troubleshooting guide.

## Task 2: Implement dark theme for main page

### Steps:
1. Review existing light theme color palette
2. Create dark theme color specifications based on design system
3. Use AI to research best practices for dark theme implementation
4. Generate dark theme CSS/styling using AI assistance
5. Apply dark theme to all page elements (headers, cards, pop-ups, buttons)
6. Create theme toggle mechanism (button or automatic system preference detection)
7. Test theme switching for smooth transitions
8. Verify all text remains readable with proper contrast ratios
9. Check that gradients and animations work well in dark theme
10. Test across different devices and browsers
11. Fix any contrast or visibility issues manually
12. Save dark theme code and update prompts documentation

### Resources and Links:
- [Google Disk Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZLYoKkszAJQLCUKq2_ArUi6xF3pcj-k7iTaHGJpFEE/edit?usp=drive_link)
- [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/C98LlsjW6rMa0Gxwg6VzCY/RH-Website-2025?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=urYcwTnZhLBq5TZS-0)
- Design system color guidelines
- WebAIM contrast checker for accessibility

### Instructions:
Start by documenting every color currently used in the light theme. Create a dark theme palette that maintains the same visual hierarchy and brand identity. Use AI to generate the initial dark theme implementation, but expect to make manual adjustments for optimal contrast and readability. Pay special attention to employee cards and pop-up windows—these need to look cohesive in both themes. Test the theme toggle extensively; users should be able to switch back and forth without any layout shifts or broken elements. Use accessibility tools to verify text contrast meets WCAG standards. Consider adding a smooth fade transition when switching themes for a polished feel.

## Task 3: Create 3D variant of employee card

### Steps:
1. Use AI to research 3D CSS techniques and best practices
2. Review current 2D employee card design for elements to enhance
3. Sketch or describe desired 3D effect (depth, rotation, parallax, etc.)
4. Generate initial 3D card code using AI with specific prompts
5. Test 3D effects in browser and adjust parameters
6. Ensure 3D card maintains readability and usability
7. Add interactive 3D animations (hover, tilt, rotation)
8. Optimize performance to prevent lag or jank
9. Make manual adjustments to fine-tune 3D appearance
10. Test on different devices (3D effects can be performance-intensive)
11. Create fallback version for older browsers or low-performance devices
12. Document 3D implementation in prompts for reproducibility
13. Import 3D version to Figma using the free plugin

### Resources and Links:
- [Google Disk Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wn8DJquejx8Mjm5tVkYmG-ZfTaMGnao7DZHwHCwzq50/edit?usp=drive_link)
- [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/C98LlsjW6rMa0Gxwg6VzCY/RH-Website-2025?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=urYcwTnZhLBq5TZS-0)
- CSS 3D transform references
- Three.js documentation (if needed for advanced effects)
- CodePen examples of 3D cards

### Instructions:
Research existing 3D card designs for inspiration before starting. Decide whether to use pure CSS 3D transforms or a library like Three.js (CSS is simpler and more performant for basic 3D effects). Use AI to generate the base 3D card structure, providing clear prompts about desired depth, shadow, and rotation effects. The 3D version should enhance the design without sacrificing the employee information readability. Consider adding a subtle tilt effect on hover that responds to mouse position for an engaging interaction. Test extensively on mobile devices—3D effects can drain battery and cause performance issues on older phones. Create a simplified version that activates on lower-performance devices. Once satisfied with the 3D card, use the Figma plugin you found to import it for design documentation.

## Task 4: Test and optimize all animations

### Steps:
1. Create comprehensive list of all animations on the page
2. Test each animation for smoothness (target: 60fps)
3. Use browser performance profiler to identify bottlenecks
4. Optimize CSS animations (use transform and opacity when possible)
5. Replace JavaScript animations with CSS where feasible
6. Add will-change property for frequently animated elements
7. Test animations on low-end devices and throttle CPU to simulate
8. Reduce animation complexity if performance issues detected
9. Ensure animations respect user's prefers-reduced-motion setting
10. Test animations in all browsers for consistency
11. Document animation specifications for future reference
12. Update prompts with optimized animation code

### Resources and Links:
- [Google Disk Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZLYoKkszAJQLCUKq2_ArUi6xF3pcj-k7iTaHGJpFEE/edit?usp=drive_link)
- Browser DevTools performance profiler
- CSS animation performance guides
- FPS monitoring tools

### Instructions:
Open browser DevTools and record performance while interacting with the page. Watch for frame drops or janky animations. CSS transform and opacity are GPU-accelerated and perform best—convert any animations using top/left/width/height properties. Be especially careful with the 3D card animations; these can be resource-intensive. Test on an older phone or laptop by throttling CPU in DevTools. If animations cause performance issues, simplify them or reduce their frequency. Add the prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect accessibility preferences. Document your findings and create a performance baseline so you can track improvements.

## Task 5: Create backup prompts for Gemini alternatives

### Steps:
1. Research alternative AI coding tools (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
2. Test each tool with your existing main page code
3. Adapt your current prompts to work with each alternative tool
4. Document specific quirks or differences for each AI tool
5. Create tool-specific instructions for common tasks
6. Test prompt reproducibility with each tool
7. Rank alternatives by reliability and output quality
8. Download and save all backup prompts to Google Drive
9. Create quick-reference guide for switching between tools
10. Share backup workflow documentation with team

### Resources and Links:
- Current prompt documentation on Google Drive
- [Google Disk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZLYoKkszAJQLCUKq2_ArUi6xF3pcj-k7iTaHGJpFEE/edit?usp=drive_link)
- Alternative AI tool websites (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Team communication channel for sharing findings

### Instructions:
Since Gemini has crashed during your work, having backup AI tools is essential for uninterrupted productivity. Test your main page creation prompts with at least three alternative AI tools. Note differences in how each tool interprets prompts and generates code. Some tools are better at specific tasks (e.g., one might excel at CSS while another is better at JavaScript). Document these strengths so you know which tool to use for which task. Create a decision tree: "If Gemini is down → try Claude → if Claude hits limits → use ChatGPT" with adapted prompts for each. Save everything in a clearly organized section of your Google Drive so you can access it quickly during an outage.

## Task 6: Optimize Figma file organization

### Steps:
1. Review current Figma file structure and identify disorganization
2. Use the free Figma plugin to ensure all latest designs are imported
3. Create clear naming convention for all frames and components
4. Organize designs into logical pages (Main Page, Employee Cards, Components, etc.)
5. Add descriptions and notes to complex designs
6. Create component library for reusable elements
7. Set up color styles and text styles for consistency
8. Version control: label designs with dates or version numbers
9. Archive old versions but keep them accessible
10. Share organized file with team and gather feedback
11. Document Figma organization structure in Google Drive

### Resources and Links:
- [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/C98LlsjW6rMa0Gxwg6VzCY/RH-Website-2025?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=urYcwTnZhLBq5TZS-0)
- [Google Disk for documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZLYoKkszAJQLCUKq2_ArUi6xF3pcj-k7iTaHGJpFEE/edit?usp=drive_link)
- Figma plugin for code import
- Figma best practices guides

### Instructions:
Open your Figma file and audit its current state. You've been importing multiple versions of designs, so organization is crucial. Create separate pages for different aspects of the project: one for the full main page designs, one dedicated to employee card variations, one for individual components (buttons, pop-ups, icons), and one for archived/experimental designs. Use consistent naming like "Main-Page-v3-Light-Theme" or "Employee-Card-2D-Final". Since you found a free plugin that imports code to Figma, use it to bring in your latest work. Create shared color and text styles so any team member can maintain design consistency. Add comments or notes explaining design decisions, especially for the 3D card variant. This organization will save significant time when you or team members need to reference designs later.
