Break each plan item into specific steps
Add links and resources
Clear instructions for execution
Task 1: Select and finalize best main page version
Steps:
Open all three main page versions side by side in different browser tabs
Use AI to help analyze pros and cons of each version
Create a comparison checklist (visual appeal, usability, performance, design system adherence)
Test each version on mobile, tablet, and desktop
Check animations, interactions, and overall user experience for each
Document strengths and weaknesses of each version
Consider client requirements and project goals
Select the best version based on comprehensive evaluation
Make final manual refinements to selected version

Resources and Links:
Version 1 Documentation
Version 2 Documentation
Design System Reference
Instructions:
Open each version in a separate browser window and view them simultaneously. Create a scoring system for key criteria: visual appeal (1-10), usability (1-10), performance (1-10), design consistency (1-10), and innovation (1-10). Test each version thoroughly on different devices. Pay attention to how employee cards look, how pop-ups function, how buttons respond, and how smooth animations are. Consider which version best represents the brand and meets project goals. Use Cursor with Claude to get an objective analysis of code quality for each version. Document your decision-making process. Once selected, make any final polish adjustments and create a clear backup with version number and date.

Task 2: Create comprehensive prompts for selected version
Steps:
Use the created files from selected version to analyze complete structure
Break down the page into logical sections (header, cards, pop-ups, footer, modals)
Use AI to help document each section's code and design specifications
Include all color values, font specifications, spacing measurements
Document all animations with timing and easing functions
Describe all interactive elements and their behaviors
Include icon SVG code for all buttons
Add responsive breakpoints and behavior descriptions
Test the prompt by using it to recreate elements from scratch
Make changes manually to prompt based on test results
Fill all of the prompt documentation files
Upload to Google Drive with version number
Resources and Links:
Selected Version Code
Prompt Template
Design System
Instructions:
Start by opening the selected version's code and identifying all major components. For each component, document its structure, styling, and functionality in extreme detail. Use Claude in Cursor to help extract and organize this information. The prompt should be so detailed that someone with no prior knowledge could recreate the page. Include exact hex color values (not just "blue"), specific font weights (not just "bold"), precise pixel measurements. Document the button grid layout, the overlay gradient formula, the animation keyframes. Test your prompt by using it in a fresh AI conversation—if the AI struggles or makes mistakes, your prompt needs more clarity. This is the master documentation that makes your work reproducible.

Task 3: Begin 3D variant of employee card exploration
Steps:
Use AI to research 3D CSS card techniques and best practices
Study examples of 3D cards on CodePen and similar platforms
AI gives the instructions on how to implement 3D transforms
Create initial 3D card prototype with basic perspective
Add depth using shadows, layering, and transform properties
Implement hover interaction with subtle tilt effect
Make changes manually if AI-generated code has issues
Test 3D card on different devices for performance
Create fallback version for browsers without 3D support
Compare 3D version with flat version side by side
Document 3D implementation process
Resources and Links:
Employee Card Base
3D Examples Research
Instructions:
Begin by researching 3D card effects on CodePen—look for cards with subtle depth that enhance rather than distract. Use Cursor with Claude to generate initial 3D CSS code. The key properties you'll work with are: transform, perspective (typically 1000px-1500px), transform-style: preserve-3d, and rotateX/rotateY for tilt effects. Start simple with just adding depth, then add hover interactions. Consider using a JavaScript library to track mouse position for more dynamic tilt effects. Be careful with performance—3D transforms can be GPU-intensive. Test early and often on mobile devices. If performance is poor, create a simplified mobile version or disable 3D on smaller screens. The goal is to enhance the card's visual appeal without sacrificing usability or performance.

Task 4: Cross-version comparison documentation
Steps:
Create comparison document with side-by-side screenshots of all three versions
Use created files to document technical differences between versions
List visual design differences (colors, layouts, animations)
Document interaction differences (button behaviors, pop-up styles)
Compare performance metrics (load times, animation smoothness)
Note unique features of each version
Fill all comparison criteria sections
Add recommendations for which version works best for different use cases
Include pros and cons for each version
Upload comprehensive comparison to Google Drive
Resources and Links:
Version 1
Version 2
Version 3
Instructions:
Create a comprehensive comparison document that serves as both an internal reference and a client presentation tool. Take high-quality screenshots of each version showing: homepage view, employee card details, pop-up windows, button interactions, and mobile responsive views. Create a comparison table with rows for: Visual Design, User Experience, Performance, Innovation, Design System Adherence, and Development Complexity. For each criterion, rate each version and explain why. Note specific differences: "Version 1 uses gradient buttons while Version 2 uses flat design," "Version 3 has smoother animations but slightly longer load time." This document should help stakeholders understand the trade-offs and make an informed decision.

Task 5: Performance optimization across all versions
Steps:
Use AI to analyze code for performance bottlenecks
Identify large assets (images, fonts) that need optimization
Compress and optimize all images without quality loss
Minify CSS and JavaScript where applicable
Review animation performance using browser dev tools
Check for unused CSS and remove it
Optimize font loading strategy
Test page load times before and after optimization
Make changes manually to code for better performance
Document performance improvements for each version
Upload optimized versions to Google Drive
Resources and Links:
All Version Files
[Performance Testing Tools](Browser DevTools)
Instructions:
Start by using browser DevTools to measure current performance. Open Performance tab and record while the page loads and you interact with it. Look for: long tasks, layout thrashing, slow animations. Use Lighthouse to get performance scores. Common optimizations: compress images using tools like TinyPNG, ensure images are properly sized (don't use 2000px images scaled down to 400px), lazy load images below the fold, use font-display: swap for web fonts, minimize JavaScript execution time. For animations, ensure you're only animating transform and opacity properties (these are GPU-accelerated). Remove any unused CSS classes. Test again after each optimization to measure improvement. Document before/after metrics: load time, First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive. Aim for Lighthouse performance score of 90+.

Task 6: Create backup prompts for alternative versions
Steps:
Use created files from versions not selected to create their prompts
Document each non-selected version's unique features
AI helps structure prompts for reproducibility
Test each prompt to ensure it works correctly
Fill all the files for each version's prompt documentation
Add notes about why version wasn't selected but might be useful later
Organize prompts with clear version numbers
Upload all version prompts to Google Drive
Resources and Links:
Version Comparison Doc
Prompt Templates
Instructions:
Even though you've selected one version as primary, the other versions represent valuable work and design exploration. Create complete prompts for each non-selected version following the same detailed approach as your primary prompt. These serve as: backup options if client wants to see alternatives, inspiration for future projects, examples of different design approaches. Document what makes each version unique: "Version 2 uses bold gradients and dramatic shadows for a modern look," "Version 3 prioritizes minimalism and clean lines." Test each prompt by trying to recreate key components. Store these prompts in an organized folder structure on Google Drive: "Main-Page-Prompts/Version-1-Selected/", "Main-Page-Prompts/Version-2-Alternative/", etc.

Task 7: Export all versions to Figma
Steps:
Use the free Figma plugin to prepare code for import
Export version 1 HTML/CSS to Figma
Export version 2 HTML/CSS to Figma
Export version 3 HTML/CSS to Figma
Organize Figma file with clear page structure
Name all layers and components clearly
Add annotations explaining key design decisions
Create component library from common elements
Add comparison view showing all three versions side by side
Share Figma file with team
Document Figma link in Google Drive
Resources and Links:
All Version Codes
Figma Plugin Guide
Instructions:
Use the free Figma plugin you discovered previously to import your HTML/CSS designs into Figma. This creates design documentation that designers and stakeholders can easily view and comment on without needing to run code. Import each version on a separate Figma page. Clean up the imported layers—the plugin may create messy layer names. Group related elements logically: "Employee Card Components," "Pop-up Modals," "Button Styles." Create a components page where you extract reusable elements like buttons and icons into Figma components. Add text annotations explaining design decisions: "Used this gradient to create depth," "Button size follows 8px grid system." Create a final comparison page with all three versions visible. This Figma file becomes your design system documentation and client presentation tool.

Task 8: Team presentation preparation
Steps:
Use created files to gather all necessary materials
Create presentation outline covering all three versions
Add screenshots and comparisons from previous tasks
Document technical specifications and performance metrics
Prepare talking points about design decisions
Fill all presentation slide content
Add recommendations for version selection
Include next steps and timeline
Review presentation with fresh perspective
Upload final presentation to Google Drive
Share with team for feedback before client presentation

Performance Metrics
[Figma File](Link after Task 7 completion)
Instructions:
Create a professional presentation that tells the story of your design process. Structure: 1) Project Overview & Goals, 2) Design Process & Methodology, 3) Version 1 Walkthrough with highlights, 4) Version 2 Walkthrough with highlights, 5) Version 3 Walkthrough with highlights, 6) Detailed Comparison (use comparison doc), 7) Performance Analysis, 8) Recommendation with reasoning, 9) Next Steps & Timeline. Use high-quality screenshots. For each version, show the full page view and detail shots of key features (employee cards, pop-ups, buttons). Include live demo links so audience can interact with each version. Explain your design decisions: why certain colors, why that animation timing, how it aligns with design system. Make clear recommendation but acknowledge that other versions have merit for different use cases. End with concrete next steps: implementation timeline, testing plan, launch schedule.
