## Activities

### [9:00 - 11:30] - [Working on main page design]
**What I worked on:**
- Today, work was done on the website's main page. Due to restrictions on working with Claude, I worked on the code in Gemini. However, due to Gemini crashing, I had to change the code manually. AI sent instructions on how to make the changes. The main work was done on employee cards, changing colors, design, animation, and text.

### [12:30 - 14:00] - [Finding and using a tool that could take the code and recreate the file in Figma]
**What I worked on:**
- Using artificial intelligence, I used several tools that were suggested to me. Several options are not available for free; you can create a file in the AI ​​itself, but you can only download it if you have a paid subscription. However, I found a plugin in Figma itself that can do this for free. Therefore, a new website version and a new employee card version were added to the Figma file.
