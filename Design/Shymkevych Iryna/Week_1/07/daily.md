### [11 - 13:30] - [Create a new version of employee card]
**What I worked on:**
- Suitable references were found to guide the creation of the employee card code. References for buttons were also found to ensure it met the requirements and design. Pop-up windows and content were created, and icons were added. A design system for this card was also implemented..

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

### [13:30 - 14:00] - [Adding information about ai what can transform code to figma file]
**What I worked on:**
- Google Drive documents were created detailing how to use various artificial intelligence tools that can convert code into Figma files.

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Paste transcript here]


**Outcomes:**
- The result were created tutorial files on google disk.

### [15:00 - 17:30] - [Implenting new employee cards for the main page]
**What I worked on:**
- I worked on the website’s main page. Since there were restrictions on using Claude, I made the updates through Gemini. After Gemini crashed, I had to apply the changes manually (new employee cards), following the AI’s instructions. Most of the work focused on the employee cards — updating their colors, layout, animations, and text.

**What**: Detailed action steps
**Include**:
- Break each plan item into specific steps

## Task 1: Continue to make a design for rh-s.com home page

### Steps:
1. Review yesterday's work on main page design (colors, buttons, pop-ups)
2. Make a research and find right references for any remaining design elements
3. Create a prompt for AI to generate/refine the right code and design
4. Test the design in browser for responsiveness and functionality
5. Make iterative changes in code by using AI (Claude/Gemini)
6. If AI tools crash, follow manual implementation process
7. Validate all elements match the IT theme and design system

### Resources and Links:
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_zVA4f2pvxLXwF560pw1oDGfKvkN7uVgDa-k7f8lBk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x8d3iiniallo
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_zVA4f2pvxLXwF560pw1oDGfKvkN7uVgDa-k7f8lBk/edit?usp=drive_link

### Instructions:
Review the current state of the home page and identify any gaps in design or functionality. Use the established design system from the employee card to ensure consistency. When working with AI tools, start with Claude if available, use Gemini as backup, and be prepared to implement changes manually if both fail. Test each change before moving to the next element.

---

## Task 2: Make a prompt for the main page

### Steps:
1. Analyze the current main page structure and all its components
2. Create a comprehensive prompt using AI to document all design elements
3. Include specifications for colors, layout, animations, and interactions
4. Check if the prompt works correctly by testing it with AI tools
5. Make specific changes to the prompt based on test results
6. Document edge cases and variations
7. Save the final prompt to Google Drive with proper naming and organization

### Resources and Links:

- https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_zVA4f2pvxLXwF560pw1oDGfKvkN7uVgDa-k7f8lBk/edit?usp=drive_link

### Instructions:
Create a detailed, reusable prompt that captures all aspects of the main page design. The prompt should be specific enough that any AI tool can recreate the page accurately. Include details about the IT theme, color scheme, button styles, pop-up behaviors, and employee card integration. Test the prompt with both Claude and Gemini to ensure it works across platforms.

---

## Task 3: Test and optimize employee card implementation

### Steps:
1. Use the prompt that was created for the employee card
2. Test all interactive elements (hover effects, clicks, animations)
3. Verify pop-up windows display correctly
4. Check icon rendering and alignment
5. Test responsiveness across different screen sizes
6. Make specific changes with AI help in the code if issues are found
7. Document any bugs and their solutions

### Resources and Links:

- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wn8DJquejx8Mjm5tVkYmG-ZfTaMGnao7DZHwHCwzq50/edit?usp=drive_link

### Instructions:
Systematically test each employee card feature. Start with basic functionality (display, layout), then move to interactions (hover, click), and finally test animations and transitions. Use browser developer tools to check for console errors. If issues arise, document them clearly before attempting fixes. Use AI assistance for code changes, but verify each fix manually.

---

## Task 4: Document the manual implementation process

### Steps:
1. Review yesterday's experience when Gemini crashed
2. Document the step-by-step process for manual code implementation
3. Include how to interpret AI instructions when applying them manually
4. Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
5. Add code snippets and examples
6. Upload to Google Drive with clear naming

### Resources and Links:
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wM1YcvVBq9HWsxe6IgsGOfKs612_AHMYtRTev8nwVA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8qlp6p6klz5
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wn8DJquejx8Mjm5tVkYmG-ZfTaMGnao7DZHwHCwzq50/edit?usp=drive_link

### Instructions:
Create a comprehensive guide that explains how to manually implement AI-generated changes when tools crash or become unavailable. Include specific examples from yesterday's work with employee cards. The guide should be clear enough that someone with basic coding knowledge can follow it. Include screenshots or code snippets where helpful.

## Task 5: Explore alternative AI tools

### Steps:
1. Research AI coding assistants beyond Claude and Gemini
2. Test 2-3 alternatives with simple prompts
3. Document capabilities, limitations, and usage restrictions
4. Compare code quality and reliability
5. Create a quick-reference guide for when to use each tool
6. Save findings to Google Drive

### Resources and Links:

### Instructions:
Identify backup options for when primary AI tools have usage restrictions. Test each tool with prompts similar to those used for the rh-s.com project. Focus on tools that handle web development, UI/UX, and can work with design systems. Document any costs, rate limits, or restrictions. Create a decision tree for which tool to use in different scenarios.
