## Activities

### 09:11 - Team call (main transcription in 06.11.md)
**What I worked on:**
- Reviewed issues with the recruiter / CRM employee list (many outdated entries).
- Discussed Dropbox folder/profile inconsistencies and shared-folder shadow copies.
- Discussed CapCut vs Premiere/Canva, CapCut limits (export/version limits / subtitles), AI video generators.
- Client negotiation: client declined / reduced scope due to price — consequences for resource allocation.
- Scheduling conflicts for team members (Natasha, Nastya, Dasha) and requests for half-day/full-day swaps.
- Tasks assignment: portraits for the first 15 positions, profile audit, Dasha's video processing, prepare onboarding presentation scenario, update status field (available/project).
- WhisperFlow/recording issues observed (partial captures, mic differences).

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
- Full raw transcript saved in [Onboarding_Yuliia_Files/Dailis/report/06.11.md](Onboarding_Yuliia_Files/Dailis/report/06.11.md).

**Outcomes:**
- Agreed actions: run profile audit, prepare portrait list (priority 1), process Dasha’s video folder and transcriptions, generate plans & tasks (see plans.md and task.md).
- Owner assignments discussed verbally (Kolia, Dasha, Polina, Villy referenced).

## Activities (other)
- Verified CapCut version issues reported by team — note: free vs pro behaviors; export/version limits cause friction.
- Noted licensing concerns for music/assets; recommend using YouTube free music or internal-licensed assets.
- Confirmed immediate need: identify missing employee profiles and mark status (available/project) for reporting.

---

## Notes
- Priority: complete profile audit + portraits for top 15 people, then ingest videos and transcriptions into reports.
- Use transcript file [06.11.md](Onboarding_Yuliia_Files/Dailis/report/06.11.md) as source of truth for meeting claims and timestamps.

## Reminder
- WhisperFlow ON during all activities where relevant and attach transcripts.
- Update this file throughout the day.
- Link any generated outputs into relevant person folders in Dropbox and add links in reports.
