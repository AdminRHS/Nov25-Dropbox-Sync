### Resources and Links:
- [Runway Gen-2 Documentation](https://help.runwayml.com/)
- [Runway Animation Tips](https://runwayml.com/tutorials/)
- Current mascot animations for comparison
- Team feedback notes
- Animation quality checklist

### Instructions:

**Identifying "Frozen" Animation Issues:**
- Look for animations where mascot appears static with minimal movement
- Check if only background is moving while character stays still
- Identify animations where movement is too subtle or barely noticeable
- Note which body parts should move but don't (e.g., raised paw that doesn't move)

**Solutions for More Fluid Animation:**

**1. Prompt Engineering for Movement:**
- Instead of: "mascot standing"
- Try: "mascot gently swaying, breathing naturally, slight head movement"
- Add motion verbs: waving, dancing, bouncing, looking around
- Specify body parts that should move: "tail swishing, eyes blinking, ears twitching"

**2. Runway Parameter Adjustments:**
- Increase motion intensity (but not too much - avoid jittery motion)
- Extend animation duration (4-5 seconds instead of 2-3)
- Use "camera subtle zoom in" to add dimension
- Try different motion modes in Runway settings

**3. Reference Image Selection:**
- Use reference images that already suggest motion
- Avoid perfectly symmetrical, static poses
- Choose images with dynamic angles and energy
- Include multiple reference images showing motion sequence

**4. Post-Processing:**
- Consider slight speed adjustments in editing software
- Add easing effects for smoother start/end
- Loop animations seamlessly for continuous play

**Animation Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Character shows clear, visible movement
- [ ] Movement appears natural and fluid (not robotic)
- [ ] Multiple body parts move (not just one element)
- [ ] Animation loops smoothly if intended to loop
- [ ] Motion feels appropriate for character personality
- [ ] No glitches or distortions in movement
- [ ] Background and character movement are coordinated
- [ ] Animation duration is appropriate (not too short)
- [ ] Frame rate is smooth (no stuttering)

**Testing Process:**
1. Create animation with old technique
2. Create same animation with improved technique
3. Play both side-by-side for comparison
4. Note specific improvements
5. Get team member feedback on both versions
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Once satisfied, apply to all mascots

  - Environmental objects
- Exception: Character-defining elements (e.g., glasses if part of core design)

**3. Background Handling:**
- Always specify: "transparent background" or "white background"
- Avoid complex environment descriptions
- Keep focus on character only
- No text or letters in background

**4. Reference Image Guidelines:**
- Use only character-focused images
- No objects visible in reference images
- Clean, simple composition
- Multiple angles if possible
