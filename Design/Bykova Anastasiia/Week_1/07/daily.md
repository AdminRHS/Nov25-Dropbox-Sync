"Radio or company? Or what do we have there? These images can... Yaroslav, can you show us now? This one. We need a link, right? Where should it be on the company website, I understand. Yes. We need... On the old site. Hmm? Should we look at the old site, no? Actually, by the way, we can on the old one too. Yes, and on the old site these links lead to partner sites. Oh, great! Ah, okay, then the first question is resolved. The second question we had... Aha, links to videos, right? To YouTube, I understand. Yes. There, on the original site... Yes. These links, like, lead to YouTube with videos. So these four - these four videos are needed? Yes. Or which ones? Aha. Are they labeled the same way there? Hmm. Or am I missing something... Only one from another - Yes. Here. Radiy. Unclear. Otherwise, everything's okay. Ah... And what was the third thing? Oh, the 'learn more' button. In this block - 'training programs'. Where should it lead? It should open the full text. I just did it that way because there was too much text. Ah! Exactly. So let's go, I'll show you now. Ranyno. I won't show this. But up here, you know, this text should open now. That's it. Question resolved. There's a road here, I saw it. So, that's all? Okay, Yaroslav. Well yes. Okay. Aha, he's like that, with such a picture, with mandatory NK. That's it, Nastya, thank you. Good. Have a nice day! What? Oh, section! Damn, the only thing, you know, that I don't like."

Also, using ChatGPT and Gemini, I developed a peacock mascot variant and a flamingo mascot variant and other variants. https://www.figma.com/design/nRpOsCGoHcVoi1HCqUvArb/ANY_EMPLOYEE?node-id=5806-2&t=auvuklr9UrIErcQ1-1"

### [15:30 - 15:35] - Call with Developers about HoneyStone Project
**What I worked on:**
- Discussed card hover effects and clickability
- Clarified user interaction design for information cards

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**
"And here it's clear that on hover you... it changes for us, right? Ah, look, it's not quite clear when exactly. When you just hover over the card, or when you hover over the button. Exactly when on the card. Uh-huh. Just, well, purely from experience, right, from my own, when I hover somewhere and the style changes, I feel - The feeling is that I can click on it. But in fact, only the button is clickable for us. So here, well, not quite. Oh, you already removed - No, no, I'm doing the opposite... Ah, okay, yes, you'll remove that one then. Yes-yes-yes. Yes, and well, the question is, Stas didn't like it either, right? Either the whole card is clickable, or then remove - Yes. Maybe it's not great from a design perspective, but I thought there would be both the button and the whole card clickable. Yes, I also thought they would have a button. Both? Well, then Yaroslav, swallow your pride and that's it. Only with the style, it's bad. Okay. So we have a button and a card, and in fact, there's no point in the button, right? No-no. There is a button and it has a point because it's a design thing and it's a stimulus because - Like it pushes. Yes, it's just an informational card with nothing special on it. Well, okay Yaroslav, you just make the whole card clickable and remove its hover state, in short. Hover... You know, I... Did you insert the videos? I already forgot to say. Nastya, thank you... Nastya, that guy isn't responding, right? What? No-no-no that guy isn't responding. Until - until what time will he be busy there? Well... he didn't write anything at all. I don't know. Well, you said until Friday or something... so he said back then when he offered to talk about icons, he said he'd be free on Friday morning already, and in the morning is good, well I sent him the file but he never answered my question. I see, then you make the cards. Okay. Nastya, we're done already, Yaroslav. I'm also saying we. Well then I'm writing like this. aha"

**Outcomes:**
- Decision made: entire card will be clickable, not just button
- Hover state to be removed from card to avoid confusion
- Videos confirmed as inserted
- Backup plan established for icon design if vendor doesn't respond
- Developer will proceed with creating clickable cards
