## Task 2: Review and QA HoneyStone Website Card Implementation

### Steps:
1. Wait for Yaroslav to implement clickable card functionality
2. Review the implemented changes on staging/development site
3. Test hover states to ensure they're removed as discussed
4. Verify entire card area is clickable (not just button)
5. Test on different browsers and devices
6. Check that YouTube video links are working correctly (all 4 videos)
7. Verify partner logo links connect to correct partner websites
8. Test "Learn More" expandable section in training programs
9. Provide feedback to developers if any issues found

### Resources and Links:
- HoneyStone old website (for reference)
- Development/staging site (to be provided by developers)
- Meeting notes from calls (11:30-11:42 and 15:30-15:35)

### Instructions:
The key change agreed upon is making the entire information card clickable while removing the hover state that was causing confusion. Users should understand the card is interactive without misleading hover effects. Ensure the design maintains visual appeal while improving user experience. Document any bugs or inconsistencies and communicate them clearly to the development team.

## Task 3: Follow Up on Icon Designer and Plan Alternative

### Steps:
1. Check for any response from icon designer (last contacted about Friday availability)
2. If no response by end of Tuesday, send follow-up message
3. Set deadline for response (e.g., Wednesday EOD)
4. If still no response, prepare to create cards/icons internally
5. Review existing design assets that could be adapted
6. Allocate time in schedule to create icons if needed
7. Communicate status and timeline to project stakeholders

### Resources and Links:
- Previous communication with icon designer
- HoneyStone project files and requirements
- Design tools: Figma, ChatGPT, Gemini

### Instructions:
The icon designer was supposed to be available Friday morning but hasn't responded to file share. Give them reasonable time to respond (24-48 hours) but have backup plan ready. If proceeding internally, maintain consistent style with existing HoneyStone design elements. Prioritize functionality over perfection if timeline is tight.

## Task 4: Document Mascot Creation Workflow

### Steps:
1. Review all mascot projects completed (HR Bear, Tiger, Arctic Fox)
2. Write step-by-step workflow documentation
3. Include prompt templates used for generation
4. Document which AI tools work best for different mascot styles
5. Add tips for background removal and image preparation
6. Create checklist for mascot deliverables
7. Note common issues and solutions
8. Share documentation with team for future mascot projects

### Instructions:
Create comprehensive documentation so other team members can replicate the mascot creation process. Include specific prompt examples that worked well, AI tool comparison (ChatGPT vs Gemini strengths), and the 9-pose framework for emotions/actions. This will speed up future mascot development and ensure consistency across all employee role mascots.
