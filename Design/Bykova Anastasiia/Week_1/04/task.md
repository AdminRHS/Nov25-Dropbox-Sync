## Task 1: Complete Design System Documentation

### Steps:
1. Audit existing components and identify documentation gaps
2. Create standardized documentation template for all components
3. Document each component with usage examples, props/variations, and accessibility notes
4. Add visual examples and code snippets for each component
5. Review and validate documentation with development team
6. Publish updated documentation to shared repository

### Resources and Links:
- [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Design System Checklist](https://www.designsystemchecklist.com/)
- [Component Documentation Best Practices](https://www.designsystems.com/)
- [Figma Design Files](figma://design-system)

### Instructions:

Start by conducting a comprehensive audit of all existing components in the design system. Create a spreadsheet listing each component and its current documentation status. Use this to prioritize which components need immediate attention.

For each component, follow the documentation template structure: component name, description, when to use, variants available, accessibility considerations, code examples, and visual examples. Ensure all screenshots are up-to-date and accurately represent the current component state.

Work closely with developers to ensure technical accuracy and include actual implementation code snippets. Schedule a review session before finalizing to catch any errors or omissions.

## Task 2: Review and Update Project Timeline

### Steps:
1. Review current project timeline and compare with actual progress
2. Identify any delays or blockers affecting the schedule
3. Meet with stakeholders to discuss timeline adjustments
4. Update project management tool with revised milestones
5. Communicate changes to all team members
6. Set up weekly check-ins to monitor progress

### Resources and Links:
- [Project Management Tool](https://asana.com/)
- [Gantt Chart Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)
- [Team Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
- [Stakeholder Contact List](notion://contacts)

### Instructions:

Begin by gathering data on current progress for all active tasks. Create a comparison document showing original timeline vs. actual completion dates to identify patterns and problem areas.

Schedule a meeting with key stakeholders to discuss any necessary timeline adjustments. Come prepared with specific recommendations and justifications for changes. Be realistic about capacity and resource constraints.

Once the updated timeline is approved, update all project documentation and communicate changes clearly to the entire team. Set up recurring check-ins to ensure the project stays on track going forward.

## Task 3: Stakeholder Feedback Implementation

### Steps:
1. Compile all feedback from recent design reviews
2. Categorize feedback by priority and effort required
3. Create detailed action items for each piece of feedback
4. Design updated versions incorporating the feedback
5. Prepare presentation showing before/after comparisons
6. Schedule follow-up review with stakeholders

### Resources and Links:
- [Feedback Document](notion://feedback-log)
- [Design Review Notes](gdocs://review-notes)
- [Figma Working Files](figma://project-files)
- [Presentation Template](slides://template)

### Instructions:

Start by organizing all feedback received during design reviews into a structured document. Group similar feedback items together and prioritize based on impact and effort.

For each high-priority item, create specific design tasks with clear acceptance criteria. As you work through updates, document your design decisions and rationale for changes made.

Prepare a comprehensive presentation showing how you've addressed each piece of feedback. Include before/after comparisons to clearly demonstrate improvements. Schedule a follow-up review to ensure stakeholder alignment before proceeding with implementation.

## Task 4: Component Library Updates

### Steps:
1. Analyze usage data to identify most-used components
2. Gather feedback from designers and developers on pain points
3. Sketch improvements and new variants for key components
4. Create high-fidelity designs for updated components
5. Test new components in real project contexts
6. Update component library and documentation

### Resources and Links:
- [Component Analytics Dashboard](analytics://components)
- [User Feedback Form](forms://component-feedback)
- [Figma Component Library](figma://components)
- [Testing Checklist](notion://testing)

### Instructions:

Review usage analytics to understand which components are most frequently used and which might need improvement. Conduct interviews or surveys with team members to gather qualitative feedback on component usability.

Focus on making components more flexible and easier to customize while maintaining consistency. Consider creating additional variants for common use cases to reduce the need for one-off custom solutions.

Test all updates thoroughly in actual project contexts before rolling out to the entire library. Document all changes and provide migration guides if breaking changes are necessary.

## Task 5: Accessibility Audit

### Steps:
1. Review WCAG 2.1 AA requirements and create audit checklist
2. Test all components for keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. Check color contrast ratios for all text and UI elements
4. Document accessibility issues found with severity ratings
5. Create remediation plan prioritizing critical issues
6. Implement fixes and re-test for compliance

### Resources and Links:
- [WCAG Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
- [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Screen Reader Testing Guide](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/)
- [Accessibility Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)

### Instructions:

Begin by creating a comprehensive audit checklist based on WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Test each component systematically, documenting any issues found with specific details about the problem and affected elements.

Use automated tools for initial screening but also perform manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers. Pay special attention to color contrast, focus indicators, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML structure.

Prioritize fixes based on severity and user impact. Critical issues that prevent access should be addressed immediately, while minor enhancements can be scheduled for later sprints. Document all changes and create accessibility guidelines for future design work.

## Task 6: Style Guide Enhancement

### Steps:
1. Review existing style guide and identify missing sections
2. Gather brand assets and guidelines from all sources
3. Create comprehensive sections for typography, color, spacing, and imagery
4. Add usage examples and dos/don'ts for each guideline
5. Design visual examples illustrating proper implementation
6. Publish updated style guide and train team on changes

### Resources and Links:
- [Current Style Guide](notion://style-guide)
- [Brand Guidelines PDF](dropbox://brand-guidelines.pdf)
- [Typography Resources](fonts.google.com)
- [Color Palette Tool](coolors.co)

### Instructions:

Start by conducting a gap analysis of the current style guide. Create an outline of all sections that should be included in a comprehensive guide: brand overview, logo usage, color system, typography, spacing, imagery, iconography, voice and tone, etc.

For each section, provide clear guidelines with visual examples showing correct and incorrect usage. Include specific measurements, color codes, and technical specifications that designers and developers need.

Make the style guide accessible and easy to navigate. Consider creating both a comprehensive version and a quick-reference guide. Schedule a training session to walk the team through major updates and answer questions.
