## Task 1: Submit and Present Email Newsletter Test Task

### Steps:
1. Review both email newsletter HTML files for any last-minute issues
2. Test both newsletters in email preview tool or send test emails
3. Verify mobile and desktop responsiveness for both variations
4. Prepare brief explanation of design decisions and AI tools used
5. Submit HTML files and documentation to client/team lead
6. Be available for questions or immediate feedback during review
7. Document any initial feedback received

### Resources and Links:

- Email testing tools (if available)
- Client website for reference

### Instructions:

Before submitting, do final quality check on both newsletter variations. Test HTML code in browser and verify all links work (even if placeholder). Check that branding (colors, fonts) matches client's website. Prepare to explain how you used ChatGPT and Gemini to develop the newsletters. Submit through designated channel and be responsive to immediate feedback. This is a test task, so demonstrating process understanding is as important as the final design.

## Task 2: Review Client Feedback on Email Newsletters

### Steps:
1. Wait for client/team response on submitted test task
2. Carefully review all feedback and comments received
3. Identify specific revision requests vs. general feedback
4. Prioritize feedback items by importance and complexity
5. Clarify any unclear feedback points with team lead
6. Estimate time needed for any requested revisions
7. Create action plan for implementing feedback

### Resources and Links:
- Submitted newsletter files for reference
- Communication channel with client/team
- Notes from original briefing meeting

### Instructions:

Take detailed notes on all feedback received. Distinguish between "must fix" issues and "nice to have" suggestions. If feedback is unclear, ask for clarification rather than guessing. Consider whether revisions require significant rework or minor adjustments. If approved without changes, celebrate the win and prepare for potential ongoing project. If revisions needed, prioritize and tackle systematically.

## Task 3: Complete Any Email Newsletter Revisions

### Steps:
1. Review prioritized list of revision requests
2. Update prompts in ChatGPT/Gemini based on feedback

### Instructions:

Focus on radical visual differentiation. ChatGPT prompt suggestion: "List 20 bird species with dramatically different silhouettes, beak shapes, and body types. Include distinctive features that make each instantly recognizable." Priority species mentioned in previous meeting: Cockatoo (large crest), Secretary bird, Penguin, Owl, domestic birds like chickens. Also consider: Flamingo, Pelican, Albatross, Hummingbird, Ostrich.
