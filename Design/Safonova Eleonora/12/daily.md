**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[ Today I worked on improving the Account Management section of the AI Catalog / Account Management project.
During the process, several unexpected issues occurred while using ChatGPT. It detected multiple duplicate files, which I removed. However, even after that, the model couldn’t properly enlarge the icons — when increased, they became distorted and stretched, and a glowing border remained behind them, which I couldn’t locate or remove in the code.
To investigate this further, I switched to Gemini, but it also failed to identify the cause. When it tried to remove the outline, it ended up deleting the entire block. Because of this strange behavior, I’m considering completely rebuilding the Account Management tab from scratch to eliminate these bugs once and for all.
Despite these difficulties, I managed to achieve several important results today:
Fixed the issue where account cards disappeared when entering edit mode — now they remain visible.
Made all cards the same height and reduced unnecessary white space.
Added an internal scroll to the cards, improving navigation within the block.
Refined the overall layout, making the interface look cleaner and more balanced.
Currently, I’m working on fixing another issue: when switching to the AI Catalog tab, an individual card doesn’t yet open in a modal window — that’s my next priority.
In addition, I plan to continue improving the banner design and add more visual dynamics to the interface.]
