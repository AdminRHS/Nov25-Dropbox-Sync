This category includes all requests for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript edits, UI/UX adjustments, and feature implementations for the AI Catalog project.

* **Topic: Initial Navbar Layout**
    **Prompt:** "Help me edit the navigation bar (navbar). I need the search, filter, and edit buttons to be on the right, at the same level and with the same spacing as the AI and Account Management icons on the left. Please explain step-by-step how best to do this: In which part of the HTML code should I place the block with the right icons (e.g., inside a container or a separate div). How to properly configure the CSS so that the spacing, alignment, and style match the left icons. How to set the same padding, colors, hover-effects, and sizes so the right side looks unified. If I need to use flex or grid, show an example of the structure and explain why it's better. Don't write the full code—just explain the logic and indicate where to insert or what to change to make everything even and neat."
