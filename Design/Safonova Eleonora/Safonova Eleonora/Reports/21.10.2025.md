### :one: Completed Tasks

* Worked on the redesign of the **Catalog AI** page using **Gemini**.
* Converted **Catalog AI** into **HTML** and started editing it. My first attempts were not very successful because I tried to include all functions in one prompt. Later, I began generating each task separately, which improved the code quality — navigation became clearer, and the filter started working properly.
* Fixed a bug with the **“View More”** button (for example, on the *gamma+8* card). Previously, clicking “more” expanded the entire card and caused it to reopen when closing. I fixed this issue, and now it only shows additional information as intended.
* Created the first version of the **video stream card** for the RH website. It turned out quite well, but when there’s too much text in the **AI section**, it overflows the layout and covers part of the video. I planned to re-generate and adjust the placement.
* Improved the **filter layout** — the first version took up too much space. I also created an updated **search system** that expands on hover and allows users to enter text more comfortably. Fixed a bug where clicking the search icon opened the filter and blocked the content.
* Re-generated the **stream window layout** — it now has a clearer structure. However, pop-up elements such as *AI, Responsibility Tools,* and *Skills* were still being cut off. I continued working on improving their readability and display.
* Used **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, **Perplexity**, and **Lovable** for design generation and debugging.
* Converted Figma frames into **HTML/CSS** using AI tools and edited them further.
* Saved all materials and prompts in the **Dropbox** designer folder under my name, with separate folders for each project.

### :two: Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Long and complex prompts caused unstable code.
**Solution:** Started generating each function separately, which made the code cleaner and more structured.

**Challenge:** UI issues (text overflow, cropped pop-ups, overlapping content).
**Solution:** Re-generated layouts and adjusted spacing to fix visual hierarchy and improve usability.

**Challenge:** Missing PNG logos in **AI Catalog**.
**Solution:** Planned to upload the files to Dropbox and correctly link their paths to restore visibility.

### :four: Plans for Tomorrow

* Complete as many assigned tasks as possible using AI tools.
* Re-generate layouts for **Catalog AI** and the **stream window** to fix cropped elements and improve readability.
* Adjust the color scheme and restore missing **PNG logos** in **Catalog AI**.
* Check all Dropbox links and file paths to ensure everything works properly.
