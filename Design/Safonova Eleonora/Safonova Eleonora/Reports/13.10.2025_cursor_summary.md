### Main Tools Used
- **Claude AI**: Prompt refinement for CV data extraction; Instagram post rewriting; structured documentation for automation-ready prompts.
- **Google Gemini**: CV extraction prompt tailored for pasted/uploaded inputs; added company info line; Instagram story concept planning.
- **ChatGPT**: No explicit files found referencing ChatGPT usage in this folder/date.
- **Supporting outputs (non-tool-specific)**: Instagram strategy docs; storyboarding and production notes for social content.

### Skills Gained
- **Prompt engineering for extraction**: Defined strict TSV schemas, defaults, date formats, missing-field handling, and single-line output rules.
- **Documentation for automation**: Created formal, machine-readable specs suitable for API/Google Sheets workflows and validation (field counts).
- **Tone adaptation & rewriting**: Converted corporate copy to friendly/casual social formats; selected channel-appropriate voice and CTAs.
- **Creative planning/storyboarding**: Built Instagram story concepts with timing, visuals, audio/SFX, and CTA integration; generated AI image prompt library.
- **Brand/social strategy**: Clarified themes, tone, mood, pillars, and sample content for Remote Helpers/RemoteEmployees.

### Next Focus
- **Broaden tool parity**: Replicate/explore the CV extraction and rewriting workflows in ChatGPT for cross-model consistency and comparison.
- **Validation & QA**: Add auto-checks for 18-field TSV integrity, date format, and empty-field tabs; create a quick evaluator rubric.
- **Operational testing**: Run prompts on diverse real CVs; refine edge cases (multilingual names, multiple portfolios, social links).
- **Automation integration**: Wire outputs to Google Sheets/CRM; create reusable templates and snippets for teammates.
- **Content A/B testing**: Test formal vs friendly posts and story variants; measure engagement and iterate on CTAs and visuals.
- **Guardrails & style guides**: Document do/don’t examples, standardize hashtags, and maintain a versioned prompt library.
