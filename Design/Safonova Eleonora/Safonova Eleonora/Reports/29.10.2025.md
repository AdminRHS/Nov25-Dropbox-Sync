1️⃣ Completed Tasks

Today I showed my work and received feedback from the team leads.
For the first half of the day, I mainly worked on the **video stream cards** — refining structure and visual balance.
Later, I was informed that the **AI Catalog** is now the main priority, so during the second half of the day I focused entirely on that project.
I started developing the **main banner**, began **converting and adding icons** near each department tag, and planned to use **mascot illustrations** in the new banner design to make it more engaging.
Also reviewed and analyzed feedback from team leads regarding layout balance, spacing, text size, and header structure.


2️⃣ Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** The banner and header had too much unused space, and the leads suggested exploring different ways to fill it without cluttering the design.
**Solution:** Began experimenting with new compositions — testing the idea of placing mascots for each department and adjusting gradients to improve text readability in the header.


3️⃣ Tools & Software Used

* **GPT** — for generating design and layout ideas.
* **VS Code** — for implementing and refining banner updates.
* **Figma** — for icon placement and overall UI adjustments.
* **Discord & Dropbox** — for communication and sharing updated project files.


4️⃣ Plans for Tomorrow

* Fully focus on the  AI Catalog project.
* Continue developing the banner with mascots.
* Finalize icon integration near department tags.
* Adjust text size and spacing based on feedback.
