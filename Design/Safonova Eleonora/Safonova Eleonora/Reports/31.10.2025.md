1️⃣ Completed Tasks
Connected my project to GitHub and created a new repository — AI Catalog 4.
Fixed several layout and navigation issues in the filter section: deleted the old version and rebuilt it from scratch.
Repositioned icons for filter, search, edit, and theme switch inside the main header container and adjusted the header color to change dynamically while scrolling.
Cleaned up the code, removed unnecessary functions, and restored the correct icon colors.
Pinned the header to the top of the page so it remains visible during scrolling, making it easier to switch themes and access the search system.
Aligned all elements properly after multiple spacing adjustments — achieved the final result with help from Gemini.
All updates are now available in the GitHub repository.
2️⃣ Challenges & Solutions
Challenges:
Filter navigation lost functionality after layout adjustments.
CSS spacing inconsistencies and icon misalignment.
