UX/UI Designer

1️⃣ Completed Tasks
Worked on the Account Managers section and finalized the redesign stage of the AI Catalog website. Made the blocks more structured and set up the dark version — filters now appear on a dark background with white text. Also refined the color shades and improved the overall visual harmony.

2️⃣ Challenges & Solutions
Faced several issues with code generation in Gemini — the tool occasionally crashed or produced distorted layouts with misplaced icons. To achieve a more accurate result, I rewrote the prompts several times, which helped stabilize the generation process. While redesigning the AI Catalog, I also encountered some layout errors that were resolved using Gemini.

3️⃣ Tools & Software Used
Figma, Gemini, ChatGPT, VS Code, Dropbox.

4️⃣ Plans for Tomorrow
Continue refining the dark version of the interface and start designing the information window for AI cards.
