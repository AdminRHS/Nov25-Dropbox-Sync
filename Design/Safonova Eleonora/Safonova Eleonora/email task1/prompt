Create a responsive HTML email layout (desktop view, 600 px width canvas) for a B2B company called “Convenient Brands”.

Overall style:
Soft minimalistic B2B style, calm “sand + forest” color palette, flat 3D shapes with subtle depth, soft volumetric shading, rounded corners, smooth edges, premium SaaS / fintech look. Use olive greens and warm sand tones, no bright primary colors. Background uses a gentle radial gradient (sand → soft mint/olive) with subtle vignette, inspired by Ruvi-style illustrations: calm, floating, slightly 3D, but still minimal.

Color suggestions:
- Forest Olive: #4F644D
- Deep Olive: #2F3E2A
- Soft Olive: #7A9A63
- Sand Light: #FAF8F2
- Sand Neutral: #F5F3EC
- Mint Glow: #E6EFE7

Typography:
- Clean sans-serif similar to Inter / SF / Arial
- Headings: bold, 22–30 px
- Body: 13–15 px, relaxed line height
- All-caps avoided, keep a calm enterprise tone.

Layout structure (top to bottom):

1. Header
- Light sand / mint background bar.
- Left: “Convenient Brands” logo in forest olive (simple wordmark or subtle icon+wordmark).
- Right: small tagline text: “Vertical software & integrated payments for modern industries”.
- Plenty of breathing space, 18–22 px padding.

2. Hero section
- White card area on top of the gradient background.
- Left column (text):
  - H1: “Meet Convenient Brands”
  - Subheading: one line about vertical software and integrated payments helping essential industries run smoothly.
  - Short two–three line body paragraph about connecting software + payments across auto, government, property, healthcare, unions.
  - Primary CTA button: pill-shaped, soft olive background, white text “Learn more about the platform”.
- Right column: main HERO illustration.
  - Create a 16:9 illustration in the same canvas:
    - A floating 3D-style platform in sand/olive.
    - Above it: 3–4 floating cards representing dashboards and payment flows.
    - Connect them with thin olive lines showing data and payments moving between software blocks.
    - Around the cards add tiny floating mini-icons for: software, payments, automation, industries.
    - Feel of Ruvi-style floating animation: soft shadows under each object, micro-tilt, calm motion implied.

3. “Platform features” section (3 feature icons)
- Title centered: “A calm, connected platform for complex operations”.
- Short subtitle line about vertical software + payments + automation.
- Below: row of 3 equal columns, all cards the same width and height.
- Each column is a white or very light sand tile with rounded corners and soft shadow.
- Top of each tile: a custom 3D-like icon (vector) in olive + sand.
  a) Vertical Software icon:
     - Stacked app windows / rectangles, showing different panels.
     - Flat 3D, rounded corners, gentle shadows, floating slightly above tile.
  b) Integrated Payments icon:
     - Card-shaped payment symbol with small chip and two flowing lines (like waves) coming off the right side.
  c) Automation icon:
     - Gear with small connected nodes or motion dots around it.
- Under each icon: feature title and 2-line description text.

4. “Industries” grid (6 industry tiles, 2 rows × 3 columns)
- Section background: soft mint / light olive panel separate from white content.
- Title centered: “Built for industries that never stand still”.
- Subtitle: one sentence about essential services and communities.
- Grid: 6 equal tiles, all same height, same width, with white background, rounded corners, soft inner shadow, 160–180 px tall for desktop.
- Each tile has:
  - Top center: industry icon (vector) in olive + sand, matching the feature icon style (flat 3D, floating, soft shadow).
  - Bottom: industry title on 2 lines.

Create these icons for each tile:
  1) Auto dealerships & repair shops:
     - Olive car silhouette with a sand wrench overlapping it.
  2) Collision & auto aftermarket:
     - Olive car with a small sand sparkle/star above the hood.
  3) Government & municipalities:
     - Civic building with three columns and a sand checkmark badge.
  4) Property management:
     - Simple building with windows plus a sand key.
  5) Healthcare & non-profits:
     - Heart with a medical cross cut out in the center.
  6) Unions & membership organizations:
     - Circle of abstract shapes / people figures forming a group under a heart.

Each icon should feel Ruvi-like: slightly thick shapes, very smooth curves, soft depth, hovering with a tiny shadow beneath.

5. “Growth benefits” section (3 cards)
- Return to white background.
- Center title: “Quiet technology, visible growth”.
- Three equal cards in one row, all same height:
  1) Increase revenue
  2) Simplify operations
  3) Scale with confidence
- Each card has a short 2–3 line description, no icon needed or a very small olive accent in the corner.

6. “Partners” section (side illustration)
- Darker forest-olive background panel with light text.
- Left column: text block with title “A partner platform for vertical software and consultants”, 2–3 bullet points about partnering, and body copy.
- Right column: partners illustration:
  - Circular or rounded-rectangle composition.
  - Abstract collaboration concept: two overlapping dashboards, node graph, and a subtle handshake or interlocking shapes (no realistic hands).
  - Same olive/sand 3D-flat style, with bright mint glow around edges.

7. Final CTA bar
- Full-width bar in soft olive gradient.
- Centered text: heading inviting to book a demo.
- Subtext: one–two lines of copy.
- White pill-shaped CTA button: “Book a short demo”.

Icons & assets requirements:
- All icons and illustrations must be vector-based or easy to export as PNG.
- Keep a consistent visual language: same line thickness, corner radius, shadow softness and color palette.
- No photos, no realistic people. Everything is abstract, minimal, and product-focused.
- Prepare exportable slices:
  - Hero illustration 16:9 PNG.
  - 3 feature icons as individual square PNGs.
  - 6 industry icons as individual square PNGs.
  - Partners illustration PNG.
