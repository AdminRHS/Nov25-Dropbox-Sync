- Prepared animation prompt (from session documentation)

### Detailed Instructions:

**Step 1: Choose Animation Method**

**Option A: CSS Animations (Limited Email Support)**
Pros:
- Small file size
- Smooth, scalable animations
- Easy to modify

Cons:
- Limited email client support (Gmail, Apple Mail support; Outlook does not)
- Requires fallback for unsupported clients

**Option B: Animated GIFs (Broad Email Support)**
Pros:
- Wide email client support
- Reliable playback
- No coding required for basic animations

Cons:
- Larger file sizes
- Limited color palette
- Not as smooth as CSS

**Recommendation for B2B Email:** Use Animated GIFs with optimized file sizes for maximum compatibility.

**Step 2: Design Animation Specifications**

For B2B professional audience, animations should be:
- Subtle and elegant (not flashy or cartoonish)
- Short duration (2-3 seconds max)
- Slow, smooth motion
- 1-2 loops maximum, or single play-through
- Complement the content, not distract from it

Example animation types:
- Icon gently pulsing or glowing
- 3D icon rotating slowly (45-90 degrees)
- Element fading in with slight scale
- Subtle color shift or gradient animation

**Step 3: Create or Source 3D-Vector Graphics**

**Using AI Tools to Generate:**
```
Prompt for AI design tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.):
"Create a minimalist 3D vector icon representing [industry/concept],
professional B2B style, subtle gradient, on transparent background,
suitable for email newsletter, 256x256px, clean and modern design"
```

**Or source from:**
- Vecteezy.com (3D vector graphics)
- Icons8.com (3D animated icons)
- LottieFiles.com (animation files)
- Custom design using Blender or Cinema 4D

**Step 4: Create Animated GIF Version**

**Using Online Tools:**
1. Go to ezgif.com or similar GIF creation tool
2. Upload 3D vector images (PNG with transparency)
3. Set frame delay (200-300ms for smooth B2B animation)
4. Configure loop count (1-2 times recommended)
5. Add easing/transitions between frames
6. Optimize file size (target: under 200KB per GIF)

**Animation Frame Sequence Example:**
```
Frame 1: Icon at 0% scale, 0% opacity
Frame 2: Icon at 50% scale, 50% opacity
Frame 3: Icon at 80% scale, 90% opacity
Frame 4: Icon at 100% scale, 100% opacity
Frame 5: Icon settled (hold for 1 second)
Frame 6-8: Gentle subtle pulse effect
```

**Step 5: Optimize GIF File Sizes**

Critical for email deliverability:
- Maximum recommended size per GIF: 200-500KB
- Use lossy compression if needed
- Reduce color palette (64-128 colors often sufficient)
- Resize to exact dimensions needed (don't include extra pixels)
- Remove unnecessary frames

**Optimization tools:**
- ezgif.com/optimize
- gifcompressor.com
- Adobe Photoshop "Save for Web"

**Step 6: Implement with Fallback**

**HTML Structure with Fallback:**
```html
<!-- Animated GIF with fallback for Outlook -->
<td align="center" style="padding: 20px;">
  <!--[if !mso]><!-->
  <img src="animated-icon.gif"
       width="256"
       height="256"
       alt="Industry Icon"
       style="display: block; border: 0;" />
  <!--<![endif]-->

  <!--[if mso]>
  <img src="static-icon.png"
       width="256"
       height="256"
       alt="Industry Icon"
       style="display: block; border: 0;" />
  <![endif]-->
</td>
```

- [Claude Model Comparison](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview)
- [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/api)

### Detailed Instructions:

**Step 1: Identify the Specific Issue**

Common Claude issues with HTML generation:
- **Prompt length limits:** Claude has context window limits
- **Output formatting:** Claude may format code differently than expected
- **HTML specifics:** Claude might need explicit instructions for table-based layouts
- **API access issues:** Authentication or rate limiting problems

**Step 2: Review Error Messages**

Look for:
```
- "Context window exceeded" - Prompt too long
- "Unable to generate code" - Unclear instructions
- "Malformed HTML" - Claude needs more specific structure guidance
- "API error" - Access or authentication issue
```

**Step 3: Optimize Prompt for Claude**

**Claude-Specific Best Practices:**

```
1. Be extremely specific and detailed
2. Use XML-style tags for structure
3. Provide examples when possible
4. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
5. Use clear section headers
```

**Example Claude-Optimized Prompt:**

```
<task>
Create a responsive HTML email template for a B2B newsletter.
</task>

<requirements>
- Use table-based layout for email client compatibility
- Width: 600px for desktop
- Inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
- Include 6 sections: Hero, Who We Are, Industries, Growth, Partners, Final CTA
- Brand colors: Primary #4A90E2, Secondary #2C3E50
- Mobile-responsive with media queries
</requirements>

<structure>
Section 1 - Hero:
- Full-width background image
- Headline text overlaid
- Primary CTA button

Section 2 - Who We Are:
[Details...]

[Continue for all sections]
</structure>

<technical_specifications>
- DOCTYPE: XHTML 1.0 Transitional
- All CSS inline using style attributes
- Buttons using table/td structure
- Image paths: absolute URLs
- Alt text for all images
</technical_specifications>

Please generate the complete HTML code following these specifications.
```

**Step 4: Test with Simplified Example**

Start with basic HTML email to verify Claude works:

```
Simple test prompt:
"Create a basic HTML email template with a header, body text,
and footer. Use table-based layout. Width 600px. Include inline CSS."
```

If this works, Claude is functional and the issue is prompt complexity.

**Step 5: Incremental Complexity Testing**

1. **Test 1:** Basic structure (header, body, footer) ✓
2. **Test 2:** Add images and buttons ✓
3. **Test 3:** Add responsive media queries ✓
4. **Test 4:** Add multiple sections ✓
5. **Test 5:** Full 6-section template with all features ✓ or ✗

Identify where Claude starts struggling.

**Step 6: Compare with Other AI Tools**

Create comparison document:

| Feature | ChatGPT | Claude | Replit | Lovable |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
