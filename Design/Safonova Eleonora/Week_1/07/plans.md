**Based on daily.md analysis:**
- Successfully implemented glassmorphism design system with unified accent blue color scheme
- Added edit icon functionality to all cards in Edit Mode with improved UX
- Redesigned "Add New Tool" card to match overall blue theme
- Optimized JavaScript codebase by removing duplicate functions in Gemini
