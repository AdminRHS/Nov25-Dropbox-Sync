**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[So today two new people started. Yes, two new developers started, right? And there I'm trying to reach Nastya. Masha Glushko from LZOV wrote to me that she won't have electricity until 14:30 and she's asking if she can work at night to somehow make up for it, and whether that's possible. And it's kind of possible, but there's Mosik and that's the problem. If it's okay with Morka, then yes. I just think we need to inform Nastya or what? I just understand that this isn't a one-time thing. I looked - she lives in Dnipropetrovsk, and that's all going there. Well, Dnipropetrovsk-Kamianske, this is definitely not a one-time thing, it will be stable like this. So, could we warn him about electricity issues, that this kind of thing will happen? Well, no, but I understand Nastya is busy right now, but...

We sorted things out with Natasha on Friday. I called her, basically, I worked on Telegram. Right around 13:10 I finished dealing with all of this. It turned out that, basically, Iris - she has to work with Natasha according to Irish time from 10 to 14:00. And Natasha said that every time she works only four hours and not more, she gets complaints like why does she work so little. And it came to the point that now Natasha will have to write every morning. Basically, Iris says that Natasha isn't working for her, all because I think we didn't sell her those subscribers she wanted. And now Natasha has the task to write at the beginning of the day "hello, I'm here" and at the end of the day "hello, I'm leaving" because Iris basically wrote to her - she asked her at 12:00 "Natasha, are you here?" Natasha really answered her in three minutes "yes, I'm here." She was silent and then three hours later she sent her a message like "send me a report." And after three hours Natasha's time was already over. That's why it's like this.

Yes, another question. Kolya said on Friday that we should buy Adobe Firefly subscription. I wrote to accounting to buy it for admin so everyone has it right away. The question is: they're asking me now what should we buy - Pro or not Pro? He has it on mini. You don't have it. You have this paid one, right? You have it. And this one, ideally, this is Natasha's account, so we can't touch it. I asked for it on admin. The question is: what, how... I mean, you're using the paid one just together with Natasha's account, that's why you have it. And the guys also have it? So that's why I asked that everyone log in for sure on admin, so all subscriptions are on admin. And I say buy it for us on admin. There's this thing - I'll drop it in the chat now - they're asking should we buy Pro or not Pro? This morning I studied different packages that are available here. The thing is that basically the Pro doesn't really differ from the regular one, except I think in Pro you get Mobile App and Web Photoshop as a bonus. Maybe someone will need it, you know, we could buy Pro. There, basically, what's the thing - it generates video, Adobe Firefly, and on the standard package for 12 dollars you can make basically only 20 videos, 5 seconds each. And on the Pro package 40 videos. But with 20 videos we can't try anything at all. With 40 at least there's a chance. Well, yes. So I think we're buying Pro. There we have like 2000 credits and 4000, but price-wise it comes out the same, just twice as expensive. I'll ask for Pro then, so it's there. So we can try independently. How does it work then? Right in the browser? It's a browser version, I looked this morning. Browser version, yes. Just log in through admin and generate right inside. Well, it's written includes but you don't have to use Photoshop. That is, it'll be a plus. Let it be. We don't really need 20 videos. Looking at the main thing for making these drop-offs. The trick is that this thing is basically very expensive. I looked today when I logged in - in credits it turned out, damn, where did I log in? So, here I logged in from my own account to check. Here, it takes 5 points for generating just a picture, it gives 4000 points. For generating a picture it takes 5 points. And for video generation from this background, generative expansion, it takes 10 points. What I basically looked at - a total of 200 pictures on the minimum package. Generative fill - 10 points for each generative action. But it's possible. But we're buying Pro for sure. I wrote for everyone. If there won't be a subscription for this, I'll do it.

Katyunya. Yes, yes. I saw your message about Maria. Yes. Listen, write - I'll look. So she should talk with the client, with the client's court, because it seems to me now he'll start: "I'm not going to pay for this, for this, for that, for that, etc." Well, can't we warn him? For example, how did she work before without electricity? Well, well, she had, well, it was dark. It's really terrible now. Over the weekend it was terrible, so now the entire eastern part is terrible. They wrote that Svyat also wrote to me that now they've increased the outages. Now there won't be electricity for sixteen hours at all. Wow, that's terrible! Well. Well, I haven't been there - So there are no drills, roads and so on. Hello. Or there, if the light goes out, there with them or without them it's the same. Now let's ask Simona, I'll ask her to join. Hi! Can you join us? Well, when I have the light turned off, I have these special cords to the power bank and to the router. My internet works as usual. Well, maybe she knows, like, maybe somewhere at least, there, a laptop, there, for two hours, maybe it will last, until there won't be... Maybe such an option at least? Yes. Maybe there on calls, well, on calls they still need to show everything from the laptop. Yes. And designer programs, they, well, are convenient and the video card... Well yes. Because of the video card discharge. Yes. And especially Figma. They all... Here, Figma. It works. She already has a flow, but... Tetyana, I wrote. Tell us something like. Morning already. Well yes, well, everyone's morning starts at a different time. For someone eight o'clock is already daytime, and for someone it's still morning, early morning. I just dragged it because her headphones are turned off. Now, I wrote to her. Sofiya Tereshchenko: Wrote to Natasha that she started working with this, with... What's it called? Electrician Sofiya Tereshchenko: Mark 10-BJ, because he won't sign the contract for us. Narrator: Aha, okay, I'll ask her. Maria answered now. Maria, tell me please, how are you generally with all these things, with electricity, I mean? Do you not have it now or what? Maria: I don't have it now. Yes. Narrator: Yes, well, you're still working now, right? Katya: Well, I can last about two hours without light, and so, well, for now they're promising really very harsh outages. Some write that it could be sixteen hours. Lidiya Sivakova: Uh-huh. Anastasia Demchenko: Yes, we just probably need to do something here. And you don't have anything at all, no eco flow, nothing like that, right? Power banks that could work from something. Katya: Uh-huh. Moderator: Maybe... those. Coworking spaces, that's it! I remembered the word. Yes, coworking. I remembered the word. Yes, well. Are there any coworking spaces? We don't have that. None at all? Just, well yes, maybe there, you could find out the prices as an option, there, what, there, how? Yes. So, you work on a laptop, right? Yes. Yes. And there, your battery, if something, it's... Can you there, for example, if you have a second battery, replace it as an option? Just can't replace the part. No, well, I mean... I thought... Yes. What? I wanted to buy a charging station specifically, but I can't yet. And does anyone know how long a charging station generally lasts for... Well, depends on which one? Yes, there are different ones. Well, I had one from a friend who charges a full computer through it, it lasts about two-three hours approximately. Two-three hours. Aha. And how much does it cost? Fifteen thousand. That's a lot. Such an option. And in a cafe, if you work there? That is, well, there's basically a chance at least on calls, for example, with the client, so there are calls, right? Well, I'll look. Maryana Ro: We just have a small neighborhood here, and it's quite far for me to go to the city center. So I need to go around here, because usually on our left bank they turn everything off at once. And when I don't have light-

Uh-huh. So you worked for the client? Yes, I think. As an option, nothing, maybe then- It's possible. Yes. Just there you have- Well, if I know the whole call schedule from the very morning, then I can economize. As an option, you can start even earlier- I think- As an option, you can start even earlier, maybe. You know, like if you have, for example, if there at eight, maybe at seven start, work at least an hour like that? That is, before this, before the call then, maybe you know, I don't know. That is, the main thing for you is that your laptop works or even go to a cafe at the time when you have a call. Do you have calls every day or every other day? For now every other day. For now calls are every other day. Well, as an option, basically, maybe we'll survive, so to speak. And your calls are at what time? Usually at what time? Uh, usually they were in the morning around ten-eleven. Once it was at three. Uh-huh, well, usually they warn you properly in advance, right? Uh, sometimes no. Sometimes it's just today there will be a call and that's it, at such and such time, well. Well yes, and so usually it's... Tetyana Levchenko: There they warned a day in advance. Kateryna Lehostai: I just thought, if the battery, the battery just costs cheaper for a laptop, if it can be - can it be removed? Just why it would be possible, for example, to buy a battery and so you could work another two hours on the laptop under these conditions. Lilya: And today when's your call? Tetyana Levchenko: I'm looking at the schedule today, there's none. Nobody wrote to me about anything, so... Lilya: Well, let's try today then. If something you see a call, you can get on, there the main thing is that the client doesn't suspect anything at all. We'll allow you to work it off. I think the client basically doesn't care, right? The main thing for him is that you show completed work tomorrow, right? Tetyana: Well, although project managers, they can, you know, answer from the phone as an option, right? Well yes. There you can say I'm here, I'm working, etc. Yes. Uh, yes, the client-- yes, in this way. And do you generally keep a schedule according to your time? Like, for example, they gave you a schedule, does it turn on and off exactly according to this schedule for you? Such a lottery. Or it can be one thing according to the schedule, and another thing in reality? It can be anything. Well, t-today they turned it off half an hour later. Got lucky there. It happens that they don't turn it on for an hour and a half, they delay. Well, you definitely don't have coworking spaces. I mean not that you can't buy them, but basically are there any... Any coworking spaces in the city or, well, paid ones, maybe? There's wifi. Yes-yes, just maybe if I... In cafes that work, there are generators, so I'll look. Still, you need to go around and ask. And can you find out about coworking spaces just in case and send me links to them, okay, which ones you have there? If there are any, because... Okay. This is what? Coworking- Offices. Yes, yes, yes, yes, offices special, there like, even if there's no electricity, then there usually you buy... I know, Wilhelm went in Vinnytsia, he lives there, and he bought himself a subscription, a subscription for, there, about a month. That is, we need to find out the price. Maybe the company would pay for this coworking for you, as an option, right? If it there, well, doesn't cost too much, so you just... I went like, to work there, just went for some number of hours. There you just come, if- About Internet, there are special cords for nine and twelve watts. You need two of them for the power bank. That is, you connect to the power bank, to the router, and you have regular internet, with regular, another speed, such stationary. Nast, and how much overall- Light from that same lamp you turn on, that is. Yes, yes, yes. That is, power banks, there, are enough. They're not expensive, one costs something like a hundred hryvnia a year, you need two of them, maybe less, I don't know. Because when they started turning off our power, they cost a lot, four hundred, five hundred I bought and now they don't cost that much anymore. And they last more than eight hours. And how long does your power bank last? Well, you have... Two. And I have a Mac, Nastya has a Mac, just how many hours is enough to-- I have a Mac, and I can basically charge it from the power bank too. That is, I can connect it to anything. When I had Windows, I ran around local cafes here, because with Windows you can't connect to anything. In Windows like- You're like from a Power. I'm saying, and so Mac holds a charge longer. I'm saying, it's two hours with our programs. Well, and further Mac lasts for me, five... Ten hours. Yes. Whatever I do. You can get out of this like that. But again, if you put Illustrator or Designer on Mac, it won't last ten hours, five, the same. That's also, yes. Maybe, as an option, yes. But I have an old Windows, well, like, it's five years old-

Which, there, third I think, with minimal settings and it lasts, God willing, four hours. Well, I'll tell you honestly, even, well when I just bought it, it was supposed to work five hours. If you're just sitting on the internet, then yes. If you open our programs, it's two hours maximum. This is on a just-bought laptop. Well, it just eats it up. Seriously? Yes. Lasted all day. Well, that's because you didn't use our programs. Yes, yes, yes. Girl in cafe: Well, I'm not talking about that, but purely googling, like for work. Yes, they take this, this energy too much. So, I'm saying, here you can count on two hours, no more. Well, as an option, well, three maximum like, here uh- Girl: There was a project, there was VPN and this such textured program, it took everything normally. Understandably, not so much- Designer ones, but still. It would be normal if, for example, they turned off the lottery there for, uh, four-- for two hours, after two turned it on again, again for two- It would charge. And then work, charged, and it would then work. Vilya bought himself "EcoFlow", yes, a program, a link, not a program, but this thing. But again, he said, there, it, I think, lasts about an hour or something like that. Yes. Vil, tell me, how long does your EcoFlow last? I don't have EcoFlow. I have- But you had one before. A Chinese UPS and a two-amp car battery, it can last, well, many hours, only then it will charge even more hours. Uh-huh. Because you need... So I, I can, it's approximately four hours- Uh, how many hours will it charge, o-only it will both work. And it can work four hours there. But maybe more, just a car batt-- battery can't like eco word be discharged there to twenty percent, because it, it won't survive a deep discharge for long, you can discharge it there to seventy-five, to fifty without harm to the batt-- battery's health. The battery in four hours can discharge to fifty, in six hours. And then you still need to charge it. So. It charges approximately as long as it discharges. Like that. You can pi-- pick it up, just install two batteries more expensively there and, and find a UPS that charges with more powerful current. Then it will. Vladyslav Hanna: Anatoliy Khyrko: Charge faster. And this is needed for, uh, for those cases when there's light, light is uh, a little, a-a, not, not for long. For such ca-ca-ca-ca-cases you could also assemble such a configuration so it charges faster. Well, I haven't assembled it yet - this is just in my hands-hands. Yes, this UPS I have costs about six thousand. It cost- It was a bit used, so it came out a bit cheaper for me than new, well, about fourteen thousand I assembled at my time. Uh-huh. Something like that. Just if the client, uh, well, sees this, there it's just a very picky client, he doesn't like at all- ...if calls appear and so on, then there will be problems, of course. With this in general, like, well, Europeans don't understand what it's like to sit without electricity. We understand, but they don't. They need everything, no problems, nothing, right. So it's such-. And they, they have it sometimes, just probably not as regularly. Well yes, maybe once they'd react normally, but I understand this isn't a one-time thing, this... Oleksandr Okhrimenko: ...just as it is now. Just, just will be, yes. As it is. Anatoliy Khimenko: Well, basically a thing like I have, I have a battery on that. Anatoliy Khimenko: ...you can buy it cheaper too, five thousand maybe. Oleksandr Okhrimenko: Well... Anatoliy Khimenko: It'll come out to eleven thousand, possibly. Like that. Well, you need to select so that, there, the UPS holds the battery with such current that- The battery can wi-- withstand, so as not to overcharge. So it doesn't charge it with too high current, because it will there steam, steam, beat. The battery won't live long either. Yes. Uh-huh. So what do we have? For now we don't warn him, or what, that there's no electricity? Let's watch for a day or two how it goes overall. Svitlana Danylenko: Well yes, let's watch. Well, let today. If there's some song today, then tomorrow we'll be writing. If it's plus-minus... Iryna Shatalova: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Svitlana Danylenko: ...you'll write there on calls and the work will be done, then okay. Iryna Shatalova: Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Okay. Iryna Shatalova: Let's do it that way then. Oleksiy Kulchynskyi: They can fix the electricity any day, like we had last. Man: ...blackouts. Uh, Man: ...Alina there-there ten hours then sat for a day or two for ten hours without a phone, and then boom and they started. Moderator: Well yes, so hopefully somehow it will get covered.

Well, for now everything seems to suit him. I haven't managed to show him the work I already did for his project, so I don't know yet. Aha. Well, well, you need to show it at review or something. Well, you showed some work anyway, at review. Well, only my portfolio, for now at review... Girl: He bombarded me there with a pile of projects that I'll be doing. So for now we just met so he could tell me about my future work, what I'll be doing. Oleksandr Pedan: You didn't do anything at all for a whole week? Girl: No, well, no, a week I worked on one of these projects. Just for now there weren't reviews specifically for my part of the work. Oleksandr Pedan: Aha, yes, I see, yes, uh-huh. And here, it's probably planned, just in case, there, say when it will be possible. ...to show, that something there write to the manager or someone else, right? Who's responsible for that, right? Because you need to... Because they're too picky about illustrators, you can make one style, but it might not suit them, and they'll say some edits, because you need to hear feedback from them to understand what style to work in going forward, right? They, for example, I made something there, maybe there, and once they asked to make an animation, something we had there, there were problems, so we did it one way, but they say- Ah, no, we need it differently and you'll need to do it differently, right? Uh-huh. Well, they seem to have coordinated with ???, with the designer of the style, I already just communicated with her about how to finish the icons. Well, I think tomorrow we'll meet already for this review. I have almost everything ready here. Yes, and who did you work with? With Yulia, Olya or Krystyna? Well, on this work that I almost finished with Krystyna. With Krystyna? Uh-huh. Well yes, because we just called last week. Krystyna also says there, depends on the project etc., that when you don't know the project, it's also difficult. One thing you can advise there, but the client has a different vision, so you need to show it as an option. The faster you do it, the better. At least, at least show some part, so you catch the style in which he needs it done overall. Yes, right, right. Uh-huh. Right, like that. Uh-huh, right. Yes. Well okay, then. Then go, work and write to me today how it went for you. Basically, today finish work when you can, right? And going forward there- Uh-huh. -we'll see, take it from there. Write to me what's more convenient for you anyway, if something's an option... Try today, if cafes are an option, so one hundred percent we've already figured everything out- ...found out, right? When the laptop turns off, for example, right? So you already there, which one is close to you. How to work there, etc. Will it be normal or not? So, Vil, does Mosik work normally overall? If there's some noise there, or do you need directly... If she puts on headphones, she'll find out in the cafe. And that's it, it will be possible? I think headphones won't transmit noise. Well yes. Headphones with microphones, like the microphone says- Uh, external noise spills. Well yes, well and her voice will be heard better through headphones. Yes. Basically you can do without a meeting room then as an option, yes. Well. Uh-huh. So it's like, well I've seen in cafes. When, when you sit in a coworking space, for example, and you need to talk on the nose for hours, it can just disturb those who are nearby. Ah, well yes. There are, there are basics, what, like in this regard. Let everyone put on headphones, costs four and a half thousand. Sorry. Well, or you had to do it like there, a room for one, like the Chinese have. They love to do everything for one person. Should have done it like that too, a closed room, isolated, for one person. Yes. Yes. And rent it out, right? Well... With whom I last, I don't even remember on which project, there were also big calls, so I went to a soundproofed room in the coworking space, so as not to chatter in the common room where everyone works, like. Edik: Uh-huh. Well, yes or you need generally t-t-to, well just included in the time you pay for. Yes, this room as an option. Anatoliy Mikhelson: It was included, only it was included. Just needed to allocate who uses it at what time. There was a Google calendar where it was written down. Yes. I don't want my words... Such hours I'll be subjective in negotiation conditions. Uh-huh. Okay, as an option, yes.

Well, yes, he said designers haven't been working for a while, need to visit them and ask how all accounts are, everything's working and what are you doing there. Well, I visited them and their guru didn't throw them out, but on Friday everyone had Illustrator and Composer working for me. But the subscription to code on 1DD wasn't actually bought. That's why it wasn't working. And I wrote to Artemich and asked when everything works for him to come to us and to the designers and everyone log in again and make sure everything works. Yes, and have you switched to Dropbox DD already? I haven't switched yet, just need to log in there. And what's the principle there, just log into Dropbox and connect from another account and that's it, or do you need to do something else? Well, deleted Dropbox DD, all its pacts, all its files so old files don't take up a lot of time. Installed fresh and logged into 1DD. There was so much trash it's crazy. Basically Dropbox DD needs to be completely deleted, right? Like completely. And you need to install it fresh in 2D basically. Oh! Natasha's calling now, I forgot while I remember. Disconnecting now, yes.

Narrator: Nastya, just called Natasha. Natasha said, Iris, about Iris she asked right away. She said, about Iris she sent her everything, reported, wrote back, etc. She didn't react to it at all. So. Nastya: Well, that she didn't react, that's already her problems. Iris's problems. Narrator: Yes, Natasha did everything. She said she sent the report and dropped everything off. Then about this new client. Voice-over: And she started working. Worked, she said on Friday about three hours, but hasn't written back to him yet. Like that. Sofiya Stavnyi: I asked her to write that she like started work and there- Voice-over: And write to him, and then- Sofiya Stavnyi: Well yes. Voice-over: But she said she hasn't written back to him yet, just started working, about three hours somewhere, no more she said, she worked like that. Sync 1. And Because I sent him the contract again on Friday and he didn't sign it for me over the weekend. Let her now, what does he know there, where she works. Let her maybe now... Say that I started work and that's it. Well yes, yes, I asked her on Friday. I'll call again now then. Right-right.

Katyusha: Ah, yes. Talked with her. She said basically that she'll write back today. But she said that I usually write back to him when I have some result. I say: "Well, you first just write to him that I've already started working, so he's aware." Once. Halyna Murzak: Well yes, I asked him that. Katyusha: Yes. Well, she said okay, I'll write back today. Said, asked for her to send you a screenshot, uh, like, uh, well, like she'll write back to him, m. Girl: Maybe he'll sign this contract right away as an option. Sofiya: Well yes, maybe he didn't see this, didn't know, didn't notice, forgot. Girl: Uh-huh. Well, as an option. Why not? Monday started, they say. Sofiya: Sofiya: Did we manage? Girl: Yes. Yes. Sofiya: And who's working on the website with Polina? Tetyana Kulpakes: That's Stas, right? Narrator: Yes, yes, yes, with Polina. Though, well, we basically already talked with you about Polina. It seems Stas is doing it, but there you need to find out some list from the client, probably need to make a list of questions or something. Well, she for now, you see, said that she still has, they still have a lot of edits to work on that need to be done, definitely for a week, right. And then already, probably from next week we could think of something, right, like, as an option, right? Seven. So it's like that, right. And also want-- aha. Basically, she doesn't fit into this month, because her contract is until the 13th. What date? Eleven, thirteen. No, until the 13th, she doesn't fit until the 13th. She, we talked with her. Aha. I'll write, write. Now I'll think of something. Because-- she's on the project there, she's this week exactly. Tetyana Kulba: ...she's in free time, there, he basically doesn't care when she'll work, he wrote back to her, and she also wrote in chat that she, they agreed that she'll have half a day off, and two days, the 12th I think, exactly, and the 13th, she'll work, well, not in her time at all, that is as it comes out, because she there, she needed two days off,- Tetyana Vyshynska: Aha. Tetyana Kulba: -but I convinced her to work on the project, and put days off for us, right? Sofiya Vavylova: I understood, good. She already has work there with edits, with what else, with presentations, I understand. Olena Denysenko: Yes-yes-yes. Sofiya Vavylova: She hasn't gotten to them yet. Olena Denysenko: She hasn't even started on presentations. She said that, yes, uh-huh, which are there. Sofiya Vavylova: Well okay, if he continues, it will be excellent. Olena Denysenko: Well as an option, just you can attach a developer to him too and that's it. Ah, by the way, we have exactly two new developers who started today. Could attach one of them, right? And developers started? Yes. Well, frontend people it seems, Artem and Azar. Well, I saw Artem's interview there like, he has the last name Skichko, like Skachko Artem. Interesting what's there, I reviewed it. I remember they published his video interview. There something like, I wrote, a guy of this type got younger. Yes. So it's such an option. Nastya, you don't know at all who you need first now for video interviews? I just decided that these developers, maybe they took them because you need them. New ones came? Hello! Yes-yes, two frontend people. Yes. And on Friday I'll have the only interview, need lead gens there. Aha, lead gens, so for now lead gens- Lead gens and automators. Well, that's far already, we already have an automator. Well yes, yes, yes. And so, there'll be another one on Friday, but there also automators, lead gens. Well, I don't know. And who are automators? Kolya Artemchuk, our LLM people, yes, Kolya Artemchuk and his team, yes. Yes, who these reports help us write etc. Set up, these are automators. And another question. Ah, with Maria we agreed to the point that as I see it now, the cheapest option is for her, if the company pays for coworking, it costs four eight hundred or four five hundred, yes, per month. Per month or per day? Per month. This is the price per month, four and a half per month. Tetyana Myronenko: She sent it to me, but she has such a problem that for her, to get to it, to the other bank, forty minutes there. I say: "Well at least you'll work, as an option." Well, I gave her like this: "Today then, - I say, - look for cafes there etc., there where you could work, right? Look through all the options that are there, so that your electricity doesn't get turned off again etc., because there, you need to sit on Mosik for two hours with it turned off as an option." I told her,- Girl: ...sit then in Discord, as an option, from mobile phone, because Discord also eats a lot. Well. And energy, well, basically, we don't need her in Discord. The main thing is that she agrees with them that she'll install Teams mobile version. Checked, it seems to exist, and I say, so if something there on mobile phone, while you run to the cafe, answer them in mobile phone mode, as an option there. Blogger: -with laptop, yes. And nearby she has the task to-- go through all cafes nearby where you can sit and charge the laptop, yes. Just I think, just a cafe - it's such an option that she'll come today. If this is constant, sixteen hours there won't be electricity, there will be a lot of people-

Man 2: Me, Dasha also says that they now supposedly should turn it off at eleven. In the empire somewhere at wh-- at seven or, there, who knows, or at six- Hanna Fenol: Well yes, but- Man 2: That is, they'll turn off the light for the whole day. Hanna Fenol: Yes, but Dasha has it a bit simpler, because she has a tablet that lasts, right, hours? On which she basically works. Yes. So, then basically there's not that much of a difference about this. Well the only thing, maybe there- Man 2: Well, that's that. Blogger: -Uh... Man: If connection, which she has in PD, because there it's unclear what- Blogger: -Mobile should be, yes. Well, I say, it's a bit simpler in this sense, and she has Windows at all, which lasts two hours on laptop and that's it. That is, at least, at least two hours is great that it works, because I'm saying, uh, already good. So, and going forward... Just, well, what we can really offer as the cheapest option is a battery, well, I think if she changed, for example, one battery for another, that would already be four hours. Rabbit: Girl: But not an option. She doesn't ha-- it's built-in, like, non-removable battery. That is, such an option won't work. Further it comes out like this, that we have, well she has this "Ecoflow", these uninterruptible things, what, it's seemingly okay, but it costs fifteen thousand, she said. That is, seemingly it's for long if- Buy it, but it again lasts, if there are so many hours not, I don't know how long it will last. Maybe if, for example, we paid once, maybe it would be normal, but it didn't work. Again we don't know to buy such a thing. The cheapest option is now for four and a half, this is four eight hundred, this, uh, this coworking. And does our company pay like this? Girl: And there was once a period, if project people, everyone else no. But if on a project, then it's more profitable for us to pay fi-- these hundred dollars, yes, a bit more. How much is this? Well, two hundred, but not lose the client. Once there was, there was a variation. Well, I just don't know what can be thought of. Here's the option: either we just lose the client and that's it, or we pay extra for this coworking. Coworking and she at least works somehow. And we still don't know if he'll hire her, not hire her. The client himself. Well, generally normal, doesn't write anything. Well, for now I told her. Just I understood like this, this coworking is inconvenient for her to get there. Yes, I say, then look for options, well, nearby, so you can rent. Yes. Well, I'm saying, cafes etc., yes. Yes. I'm saying, so you could quickly find a place where. So when there's no energy. As an option, I told her: "Maybe while others will be showing their work?" She, and I, by the way, asked her. She hasn't shown her work at all yet. And she only worked all week with her work and that's it. Uh, and it's unknown when she, well, will show what he'll say about this at all. Girl: I already wrote, write to him when it's possible to show. He explained many projects to her, there's a lot she said needs to be done. And for now from this that he said, I only worked on one project, didn't work on another. So. And said that today they don't have a call, supposedly tomorrow is planned. So she asks the manager to show the work, so he already at least somehow we took off from this. Right. Yes, I'm just really she well... Uh because of that he doesn't write. I understood. Because he hasn't seen her work yet, yes. And we're freaking out- And when does she plan to do the survey? I don't know. She also said that they didn't say anything, uh, it varies. They have calls, she's like present, but she hasn't shown her own work specifically. Yes, such a thing. I understood. Yes, so it's like, well... Okay, then I'm off, that's it. Uh-huh. Yes, that's it then there. Uh-huh. Have a good day! That's it, have a good day.]

## Notes
- **Critical infrastructure issue**: Eastern Ukraine (Dnipropetrovsk area) experiencing 16-hour daily power outages affecting remote workers
- **Temporary solutions being tested**: Cafes with generators, mobile Teams app, power banks for router (9-12 watt cables provide internet for 8+ hours)
- **Long-term power backup options considered**: EcoFlow stations (15,000 UAH), UPS with car battery setup (11,000-14,000 UAH), coworking spaces (4,500 UAH/month)
- **Battery life realities**: Designer programs (Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop) drain laptop batteries in 2-3 hours max, even on new machines
- **Client sensitivity**: European clients don't understand electricity issues; need to avoid them noticing technical problems during calls
- **Design review urgency**: Maria needs to show initial work ASAP to get client feedback on style before proceeding further
