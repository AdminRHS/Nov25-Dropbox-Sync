## Task 1: Implement Immediate Power Outage Solution for Maria


### Steps:
1. Confirm Maria is testing cafe work today during power outage
2. Have Maria document which cafes she visits (location, wifi quality, noise level, power outlets)
3. Test critical functionality: client calls via Teams mobile first, then laptop when she arrives at cafe
4. Monitor today's work session - check if client notices any issues
5. Collect feedback from Maria by end of day on feasibility
6. If cafe works: Get list of 3-5 reliable cafe options near her
7. If cafe doesn't work: Research coworking spaces in Dnipropetrovsk left bank
8. Prepare cost-benefit analysis for management decision tomorrow
9. Make decision: company pays coworking (4,500 UAH/month) vs. other solutions


### Resources and Links:
- Maria Glushko contact
- Teams mobile app (already verified as available)
- Power bank with 9-12 watt cables for router (8+ hour internet solution)
- Coworking space quotes from Maria
- Cafe recommendations with generators


### Instructions:

**Today's Test Protocol:**
Maria has no scheduled call today, making it ideal for testing. Her instructions:

1. **Before power outage (while she has electricity)**:
   - Fully charge laptop (will last ~2 hours with design programs)
   - Charge power bank
   - Prepare mobile Teams app
   - Identify 2-3 cafes within 10 minutes of her home

2. **When power goes out**:
   - Switch to mobile Teams immediately
   - Inform team she's available on mobile while relocating
   - Go to nearest cafe with generator
   - Set up laptop, test connection quality
   - Resume work from cafe

3. **Test critical elements**:
   - Can she use design programs (Figma, Illustrator) on cafe wifi?
   - Is noise level manageable with headphones + microphone?
   - Would client calls be professional quality?
   - Can she work focused 4+ hours in cafe environment?

4. **End of day report to manager**:
   - Which cafes worked best (name, location, cost)
   - Any technical issues encountered
   - Is this sustainable solution for daily 16-hour outages?
   - Recommendation: cafe work vs. coworking space

**Decision Matrix for Tomorrow:**

| Solution | Cost | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|------|----------------|
| Cafes | Variable (food/drinks) | Flexible, multiple options | Crowded, unpredictable, may not allow long stays | Good for emergencies only |
| Coworking space | 4,500 UAH/month ($120) | Reliable, professional, soundproof rooms available | 40 minutes commute to other bank | Best if client continues |
| EcoFlow station | 15,000 UAH one-time | Own equipment, no commute | Only lasts ~3-4 hours, expensive | Not viable for 16-hour outages |
| UPS + car battery | 11,000-14,000 UAH | Lasts 4-6 hours | Complex setup, still not enough | Not viable for 16-hour outages |

**Company Policy Consideration:**
- Precedent exists: company has paid for project workers' infrastructure before
- Maria is on client project, so investment protects revenue (~$200/month income)
- Cost: $120/month coworking vs. losing client entirely
- **Recommendation**: If client relationship continues past this week, approve coworking payment

## Task 2: Get New Client Contract Signed


### Steps:
1. Confirm Natasha received instruction to message client today
2. Natasha sends message: "Hi [Client name], I've started working on the project. Looking forward to collaborating with you!"
3. Natasha sends screenshot of sent message to manager (Sofiya)
4. If client responds positively, manager reminds him about unsigned contract
5. If no response by end of day, manager sends friendly follow-up tomorrow
6. Once contract signed, confirm with accounting/HR that Natasha's hours are billable
7. Set up regular check-ins for this project (avoid week-long silence)


### Resources and Links:
- Natasha contact information
- Client name: Mark 10-BJ
- Contract document (sent Friday, resent over weekend - unsigned)
- Manager: Sofiya Stavnyi


### Instructions:

**Message Template for Natasha:**

"Hi [Client Name],

I've started working on the [project name] and have already spent approximately 3 hours familiarizing myself with the requirements and beginning initial work.

Looking forward to our collaboration and showing you progress soon!

Best regards,
Natasha"

**Why This Approach:**
- Demonstrates work has already begun (creates commitment)
- Professional and friendly tone
- Opens door for client to engage
- Subtly reminds client they have active resource working

**Manager Follow-up (if needed tomorrow):**

"Hi [Client Name],

Just wanted to check if you received the contract we sent on Friday and over the weekend? Natasha has begun work on the project and we'd like to make everything official.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the terms or need any modifications.

Best regards,
[Manager Name]"

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Natasha worked ~3 hours Friday without signed contract (already a risk)
- If contract not signed by Wednesday, pause work until signature received
- Document all work hours for billing once contract is signed
- Consider whether this client behavior (not signing contracts promptly) is red flag

**Prevention for Future:**
- No work begins until contract signed
- Set clear expectation: "We'll be ready to start immediately once we have the signed agreement"

## Task 3: Schedule Maria's Project Review Urgently


### Steps:
1. Manager messages Maria immediately: "Need to schedule review with client ASAP"
2. Maria contacts project manager or client directly
3. Propose times for tomorrow (specify she has almost everything ready to present)
4. If tomorrow doesn't work, push for Wednesday maximum
5. Maria prepares presentation of work completed this week
6. Include 2-3 style options if possible (gives client choice, increases approval odds)
7. Conduct review meeting - focus on getting clear style/direction feedback
8. Document feedback immediately in writing (email/chat) to avoid misunderstandings
9. Manager follows up post-review: "Did Maria's work align with your expectations?"


### Resources and Links:
- Maria contact
- Client contact/project manager
- Work completed: Icons and other design work coordinated with Krystyna
- Portfolio shown at start (but no actual project work shown yet)


### Instructions:

**Why This Is Urgent:**
Maria has now completed a FULL WEEK of work without any client review. This is extremely risky because:
- Client hasn't seen her actual work style yet, only portfolio
- She could be going in completely wrong direction
- One week of wasted work is expensive and damages client relationship
- The longer this goes, the bigger the potential mismatch

**Message to Client/PM:**

"Hi [Name],

Maria has made excellent progress on the [icons/project name] this week and has nearly completed the initial set. She's coordinated with Krystyna on the style guidelines.

Could we schedule a review call for tomorrow so Maria can present the work and get your feedback before proceeding further? This will ensure we're aligned on the direction.

Available times tomorrow: [list 2-3 time slots]

Looking forward to showing you the progress!

Best regards,
[Manager]"

**Presentation Prep for Maria:**
1. Organize work into clear presentation (Figma file or PDF)
2. Show 2-3 variations if completed icons in slightly different styles
3. Prepare to explain design decisions
4. Have questions ready: "Do you prefer approach A or B?" "Should we continue in this direction?"
5. Take detailed notes during feedback
6. Send summary email after call: "Based on our discussion, I understand you want [X, Y, Z]. I'll proceed with this approach."

**Post-Review Action:**
- If style approved: Continue with confidence
- If adjustments needed: Make changes to ONE icon first, get approval, then proceed
- If major mismatch: Don't panic - this is exactly why reviews exist
- Update manager on outcome and any timeline implications

**Establish Ongoing Review Cadence:**
- For new clients: Review every 2-3 days initially
- Once style established: Weekly check-ins minimum
- Never go more than 5 working days without showing work

## Task 5: Complete Dropbox DD to 1DD Migration


### Steps:
1. Create migration instructions document
2. Send to all team members who haven't switched yet
3. Schedule individual assistance sessions for those who need help
4. Verify each person completes all steps properly
5. Collect confirmation from each team member once migrated
6. Document any files that need to be transferred from old account
7. Set deadline: All migrations complete by November 13th


### Resources and Links:
- Dropbox DD (old account - being phased out)
- Dropbox 1DD (new account - target)
- IT support contact for assistance


### Instructions:

**Why Complete Uninstall Necessary:**
Simply logging into new account doesn't work because:
- Old Dropbox DD files remain and take up space
- Can cause conflicts between accounts
- May sync to wrong account
- "So much trash" accumulated that needs removal

**Complete Migration Steps:**

**Phase 1: Backup (if needed)**
```
1. Check if you have any personal files in Dropbox DD
2. If yes: Copy to local computer or USB drive
3. If no: Proceed to Phase 2
```

**Phase 2: Complete Uninstall**
```
1. Close Dropbox application completely (check system tray)
2. Uninstall Dropbox via Control Panel/Settings
3. Delete remaining files:
   - Windows: C:\Users\[YourName]\Dropbox
   - Mac: ~/Dropbox
4. Clear app data:
   - Windows: %APPDATA%\Dropbox
   - Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Dropbox
5. Restart computer
```

**Phase 3: Fresh Install**
```
1. Download Dropbox installer from dropbox.com
2. Run installer
3. When prompted to log in: USE 1DD ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS
4. Select which folders to sync (don't sync everything immediately)
5. Wait for initial sync to complete
6. Verify you see correct files from 1DD account
```

**Phase 4: Verification**
```
☐ Can access all team shared folders
☐ Can see recent files from colleagues
☐ Can upload new files
☐ Old DD account files are gone
☐ Adequate hard drive space available
```

**Team Communication:**

Message to send to all team:

"**Important: Dropbox Migration Required**

We're switching from Dropbox DD to Dropbox 1DD. Please complete migration by **November 13th**.

**Steps:**
1. Completely uninstall current Dropbox (detailed instructions attached)
2. Reinstall fresh
3. Log in with 1DD account credentials (will share separately)

**Why:** Old DD account has accumulated unnecessary files. Fresh install ensures everyone has clean, efficient setup.

**Help Available:** If you encounter issues, contact [IT support person] for assistance.

**Deadline:** November 13th

Confirmation: Reply "Migration complete" once finished.

Thank you!"

**Track Completion:**
Create spreadsheet:
| Name | Department | Migration Status | Date Completed | Issues |
|------|------------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Designer 1 | Design | Not Started | | |
| Designer 2 | Design | In Progress | | |
| Developer 1 | Dev | Complete | Nov 10 | None |

**Common Issues to Prepare For:**
- "I don't have the 1DD credentials" → Share credentials securely
- "My files are missing" → Files are in 1DD account, not locally
- "Not enough space" → Help identify files to exclude from sync
- "It's taking forever to sync" → Normal, can work while syncing

## Task 7: Monitor Polina's Project Completion


### Steps:
1. Confirm Polina's contract end date: November 13th (3 days away)
2. Review her current workload: Website project with Stas, edits, presentations
3. Track daily progress: Is she on target to complete by 13th?
4. Check if client plans to extend contract beyond 13th
5. If extending: Prepare to attach developer (Artem or Azar) to project
6. If not extending: Ensure smooth handoff and project completion documentation
7. Polina working flexible schedule: Verify she's maintaining required hours
8. Confirm presentation work hasn't started yet - must begin soon to finish by 13th


### Resources and Links:
- Polina (designer)
- Stas (developer working with her on website)
- Client contact for contract extension discussion
- Contract end date: November 13th
- Work remaining: Edits, presentations


### Instructions:

**Current Status (as of November 10):**
- Contract expires in: **3 days** (November 13th)
- Major work in progress: Website with Stas
- Upcoming work: Presentations (NOT STARTED YET)
- Work completed: Ongoing edits
- Schedule: Flexible - client doesn't care when she works
- Special arrangement: Taking half-day off, working 12th and 13th instead

**Immediate Actions:**

**Day 1 (Today - November 10):**
```
☐ Manager checks in with Polina: "How much work remains?"
☐ Estimate hours needed for: website edits, presentations
☐ Math check: Can she finish in 3 days?
☐ If no: Alert client NOW that timeline is tight
☐ If yes: Confirm prioritization plan
```

**Day 2 (November 11):**
```
☐ Polina MUST start presentations today (can't wait until last day)
☐ Website edits should be 75% complete
☐ Manager asks client: "Will you extend Polina's contract?"
☐ If extending: Discuss terms and developer attachment
☐ If not extending: Begin handoff documentation
```

**Day 3 (November 12 - Polina working):**
```
☐ Website edits complete and submitted
☐ Presentations in progress
☐ Any final client review scheduled
☐ Contract extension decision confirmed
```

**Day 4 (November 13 - Polina working, LAST DAY):**
```
☐ Presentations complete and delivered
☐ Final client review/approval
☐ If extending: Sign new contract
☐ If not extending: Project closeout, files transferred
☐ Polina submits final timesheet
```

**Contract Extension Scenario:**

If client wants to continue:

**Immediate needs:**
- New contract signed (can't have gap)
- Scope of continued work defined
- Decision about developer attachment

**Developer Attachment Proposal:**

"Hi [Client name],

We're glad you'd like to continue working with Polina!

As the project moves into development phase, we recommend attaching one of our frontend developers to work alongside Polina. This ensures seamless implementation of her designs.

We have two excellent options:
- **Artem Skichko**: [Brief description]
- **Azar**: [Brief description]

Both just joined our team and are available immediately. They can work closely with Polina and Stas to implement the website designs efficiently.

Would you like to schedule a brief intro call with one or both?

Best regards,
[Manager]"

**No Extension Scenario:**

If client doesn't continue:

**Closeout Checklist:**
```
☐ All design files transferred to client
☐ Presentation sources shared
☐ Website designs documented
☐ Handoff notes written (if client continuing with someone else)
☐ Final invoice submitted
☐ Polina available for questions (specify time period: 1 week? 2 weeks?)
☐ Client feedback collected for Polina's record
☐ Polina becomes available for new project
```

**Communication Template - Extension Inquiry:**

"Hi [Client name],

Polina's current contract concludes on November 13th. She's making excellent progress on the website edits and is beginning the presentations this week.

Are you planning to extend the engagement beyond the 13th? If so, we should discuss:
1. Duration of extension
2. Scope of work
3. Potentially adding a developer to the team

Please let me know your plans so we can ensure continuity.

Best regards,
[Manager]"

**Risk Management:**
- **Biggest risk**: Presentations not started yet and only 3 days remain
- **Mitigation**: Polina must start presentations TODAY (Nov 10)
- **Timeline pressure**: Working on 12th and 13th is good, but can't rely on everything going perfectly
- **Buffer**: None - contract ends in 3 days with no margin for error

**Manager Daily Check-ins:**
With only 3 days left, manager should check in daily:
- Morning: "What's your plan for today?"
- Evening: "What did you complete? Any blockers?"

This ensures nothing falls through cracks at deadline.

## Task 8: Follow up on Iris Client Situation


### Steps:
1. Document current Iris/Natasha situation status
2. Give Iris 3 days to respond to Natasha's reports
3. If no response by November 13th, schedule management review of account
4. Assess whether this client relationship is sustainable
5. Calculate: Is revenue worth the communication difficulties?
6. Decide: Continue with strict boundaries, or recommend ending engagement
7. If continuing: Implement new communication protocol
8. If ending: Plan graceful exit strategy


### Resources and Links:
- Natasha (contractor working for Iris)
- Iris (client in Ireland)
- Work schedule: Irish time 10:00-14:00 (4 hours daily)
- Current issue: Iris claims Natasha doesn't work, despite Natasha completing all work and responding promptly
- Background: Iris wanted subscriber boosting service, company declined, relationship deteriorated


### Instructions:

**Current Situation Summary:**

**Timeline of Issues:**
1. Iris approached company wanting subscriber boosting ($2/subscriber)
2. Company declined (Kolya: "Price won't go lower, I don't agree")
3. After rejection, Iris started complaining Natasha doesn't work enough
4. Iris asked Natasha "Are you here?" at 12:00, Natasha responded in 3 minutes
5. Iris went silent, then sent "Send me report" 3 hours later (8 PM - after Natasha's work hours)
6. Iris complained to management: "Why doesn't Natasha answer at 8 PM?"
7. Natasha works 12:00-16:00 only (4 hours as contracted)
8. New protocol: Natasha must write "hello I'm here" in morning, "hello I'm leaving" at end of day
9. Friday: Natasha sent all reports and updates
10. Iris has not responded at all

**Pattern Analysis:**

This appears to be **retaliation** for not selling subscriber boosting services:
- Timing: Problems started immediately after rejection
- Unreasonable demands: Expecting availability outside work hours
- Ignoring evidence: Natasha responds within 3 minutes, still claims non-responsiveness
- Silent treatment: Not acknowledging reports sent
- Creating documentation of "problems" to potentially justify non-payment or termination

**Decision Framework:**

**Continue Relationship IF:**
- Revenue justifies the management overhead
- Clear boundaries can be established and enforced
- Iris responds within 3 days and behavior improves
- Natasha is comfortable continuing (check with her!)

**End Relationship IF:**
- Iris doesn't respond within 3 days (shows lack of good faith)
- Communication remains hostile/unproductive
- Amount of management time exceeds profit margin
- Risk of non-payment or false claims increases
- Natasha prefers to move to different client

**Assessment Questions:**

**Financial:**
- Monthly revenue from Iris: _______
- Natasha's rate: _______
- Company margin: _______
- Management hours spent on issues: _______ (at what hourly cost?)
- Net profit after management overhead: _______
- Worth it? Yes / No

**Relationship:**
- Is Iris responsive to reasonable requests? _______
- Does Iris respect work hour boundaries? _______
- Are complaints legitimate or fabricated? _______
- Trust level: High / Medium / Low / None

**Staff:**
- Is Natasha comfortable continuing? _______
- Does this affect Natasha's wellbeing? _______
- Could Natasha be placed with better client? _______

**Next Steps - 3 Day Plan:**

**Day 1 (Today - November 10):**
```
☐ Document all communication from past week
☐ Screenshot all reports Natasha sent
☐ Note Iris's non-responses
☐ Check with Natasha: "How do you feel about this client?"
☐ Review contract: Notice period, termination terms
```

**Day 2 (November 11):**
```
☐ If Iris hasn't responded: Send professional check-in
   "Hi Iris, Natasha sent reports on Friday. Did you receive them?
    Please confirm everything is on track. Thanks!"
☐ Continue normal work (don't escalate yet)
☐ Document any response or continued silence
```

**Day 3 (November 12):**
```
☐ If still no response: Management decision meeting
☐ Review financials, relationship health, staff preference
☐ Make decision: Continue with new terms, or exit gracefully
```

**Day 4 (November 13):**
```
☐ Implement decision
☐ If continuing: Send new communication protocol
☐ If exiting: Send professional notice
```

**New Communication Protocol (if continuing):**

"Hi Iris,

To ensure clear communication going forward, let's establish a simple protocol:

**Natasha's Work Hours:** 12:00-16:00 Irish time, Monday-Friday

**Daily Check-ins:**
- Morning: Natasha will message "Starting work" at 12:00
- Evening: Natasha will message "Finished for today" at 16:00

**Work Updates:**
- Natasha will send end-of-day summary each day
- You can review and provide feedback anytime
- For urgent matters during work hours, ping on [communication channel]

**Response Times:**
- During work hours: Within 15 minutes
- Outside work hours: Next business day

Does this work for you?

Best regards,
[Manager]"

**Graceful Exit Script (if ending):**

"Hi Iris,

After careful consideration, we've decided this working arrangement isn't the best fit for either of us.

We'll complete the current work cycle through [date], giving you [X days] notice to find alternative support.

Natasha will ensure all work is completed and properly documented for handoff.

We appreciate the opportunity to work together and wish you success with your projects.

Best regards,
[Manager]"

**Protection Measures:**
- Keep all communication documented
- Screenshot all work delivered
- Track all hours precisely
- Have Natasha summarize each day's accomplishments in writing
- Be prepared to provide evidence if payment disputed

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Continued non-response to work submissions
- Further complaints despite evidence to contrary
- Requests to work outside contracted hours
- Any suggestion of payment disputes
- Escalating hostile tone

**Recommendation:**
Given the pattern (demands rejected → behavior deteriorates → silence after reports sent), this client likely needs to be exited unless immediate improvement shown. The management overhead and potential non-payment risk outweigh typical 4-hour contract revenue.

However, give 3 days for Iris to course-correct before final decision.
