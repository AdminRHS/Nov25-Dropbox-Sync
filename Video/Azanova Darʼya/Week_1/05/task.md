   - Review interview length and content quality
   - Note any technical issues (audio problems, visual issues, background noise)
   - Create project backup before starting

2. **Import & Organization (5-10 minutes)**
   - Import raw footage into CapCut or editing software
   - Create organized timeline structure
   - Label clips clearly for easy navigation

3. **Basic Editing (45-60 minutes)**
   - Cut out long pauses, "um"s, filler words, and mistakes
   - Trim beginning and end for clean entry/exit points
   - Ensure smooth conversational flow between answers
   - Remove any unusable segments
   - Check for content appropriateness

4. **Visual Enhancement (30-45 minutes)**
   - Apply color correction/grading for consistent professional look
   - Add branded intro/outro if applicable
   - Create lower thirds with name/title: "Kibriyo Davlatdodova"
   - Add any required graphics, logos, or overlays
   - **If video quality is poor:** Use "window" technique (place person in decorative frame/box rather than full screen to hide quality issues)

5. **Audio Enhancement (20-30 minutes)**
   - Clean up background noise using audio tools
   - Normalize audio levels for consistent volume
   - Add subtle background music if applicable (ensure doesn't overpower voice)
   - Ensure voice clarity and intelligibility throughout

6. **Effects & Polish with CapCut (30-45 minutes)**
   - **CRITICAL:** Only use FREE features - avoid anything marked with stars ⭐ or blue highlights
   - Apply smooth transitions between sections
   - Add text animations for name/title (check they're free before applying)
   - Include subtitles if required by project standards
   - Add appropriate visual effects (currently available: New Year seasonal themes like snowflakes)
   - **Before saving:** Carefully scan entire project for any accidentally used Pro features

7. **Quality Control (15-20 minutes)**
   - Watch complete video start to finish checking for:
     - Editing errors or awkward cuts
     - Audio sync issues
     - Correct spelling in all graphics/text (verify "Kibriyo Davlatdodova" spelling)
     - Consistent visual style throughout
     - No Pro features used that would block save
   - Make final adjustments as needed

8. **Export & Delivery (10-15 minutes)**
   - Export in required format and resolution
   - Check export completed successfully without Pro feature errors
   - Upload to designated platform/location
   - Notify team of completion
   - Log work in daily.md with time spent

### Resources and Links:
- CapCut video editing software (current working version 7.4)
- Raw interview footage location (project files)
- Previous video interview examples for style reference
- Company branding assets (logos, intro/outro templates)
- Background music library (royalty-free tracks)

### Instructions:

**CapCut Pro Feature Avoidance (CRITICAL):**
- Before applying ANY effect, transition, or animation, check if it has star ⭐ or blue highlight marker
- These indicate Pro features that will prevent saving/exporting
- If you accidentally use a Pro feature, CapCut will block your save
- You'll need to find and remove the Pro feature before you can continue
- Scan your timeline carefully before final export

**"Window Technique" for Poor Quality Footage:**
- If original footage is low resolution, pixelated, or poor quality
- Don't show full-screen - it will look unprofessional
- Instead: Place video in a decorative window/frame
- Add attractive background behind the window
- This masks quality issues while maintaining professional appearance
- Makes amateur footage look intentional and polished

**Time Management:**
- Total estimated time: 2-3 hours for complete edit
- Start early in day to allow time for unexpected issues
- Save frequently to avoid losing work (CapCut can be unstable)
- If CapCut crashes or locks up, close and restart - don't force it

**Success Criteria:**
- Professional, polished video interview
- Clean audio throughout
- No awkward pauses or filler words
- Correct name spelling in all graphics
- Smooth transitions and visual flow
- Brand consistency maintained
- No Pro features blocking export
- Video uploaded and team notified

3. Prepare mental list of work completed this week (4 videos = quota met)
4. Note: 2 weeks unpaid work beyond contract
