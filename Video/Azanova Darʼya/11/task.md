## Task 2: Research and Test Zoho Platform


### Steps:
1. Assign team member(s) to deep research Zoho
2. Create Zoho account (free trial if available)
3. Watch tutorial videos on Zoho email features
4. Understand Zoho's capabilities and limitations
5. Attempt to upload HTML newsletter to Zoho
6. Document findings, challenges, and recommendations
7. Prepare summary report for team and client


### Resources and Links:
- Zoho platform (likely: Zoho Campaigns or Zoho Creator)
- Link found by team: "Business email for organization"
- Tutorial videos (YouTube search: "Zoho email campaigns tutorial")
- Team member with most technical aptitude for research


### Instructions:

**Zoho Platform Identification** (2-3 hours):

Client mentioned "Zoho" but unclear which product:
- **Zoho Campaigns**: Email marketing platform (like MailChimp) - MOST LIKELY
- **Zoho Creator**: Low-code app builder - possible but less likely for email
- **Zoho Mail**: Business email service - probably not what they meant
- **Zoho CRM**: Customer management - could include email features

**Research Steps:**

1. **Initial Investigation**:
   - Visit Zoho.com and explore products
   - Based on "HTML email newsletters" requirement, Zoho Campaigns is most probable
   - Check client document for any clarifying details
   - If still unclear, note need to ask client during meeting

2. **Create Test Account**:
   - Sign up for Zoho Campaigns free trial (usually 15-30 days)
   - Note: May require business email, not personal Gmail
   - Document any setup requirements or limitations
   - Screenshot onboarding process

3. **Platform Exploration** (4-6 hours):
   - Watch official Zoho tutorial videos (start with "Getting Started")
   - Understand key features:
     * Email template editor
     * HTML import capability
     * List management
     * Campaign sending
     * Analytics/reporting
   - Note user interface complexity
   - Assess learning curve for team

4. **HTML Upload Test**:
   - Once newsletter HTML is ready (from Task 1)
   - Attempt to import custom HTML into Zoho:
     * Look for "Custom HTML" or "Import HTML" option
     * Copy-paste HTML code into Zoho editor
     * Check if Zoho modifies/strips any code
     * Test preview in Zoho
   - Document any issues:
     * Does Zoho accept table-based layouts?
     * Are inline styles preserved?
     * Do images load correctly?
     * Any features that break?

5. **Table Handling Specifically**:
   - Client emphasized "HTML with tables"
   - Test if Zoho supports traditional table layouts
   - Many modern email tools prefer drag-and-drop builders
   - Determine if custom table code is supported or if Zoho auto-converts

6. **Advanced Features Testing**:
   - Personalization/merge tags
   - A/B testing capabilities
   - Mobile responsive preview
   - Scheduling and automation
   - Integration capabilities

**Research Report Template:**

## Task 3: Resolve HTML Coding Gap for Email Newsletters


### Steps:
1. Define the exact HTML skills needed for email newsletters
2. Evaluate all possible solutions (AI, training, developers, outsourcing)
3. Test AI-generated HTML quality (Gemini, Chat GPT)
4. If AI sufficient: Create workflow for designers
5. If developers needed: Brief Artem/Azar on email HTML requirements
6. If training needed: Schedule HTML email workshop
7. Implement chosen solution before Friday deadline


### Resources and Links:
- AI code generators: Gemini, Chat GPT
- New developers: Artem Skichko, Azar (just hired)
- LLM specialists team (Kolya Artemchuk's team)
- External resources: HTML email coding tutorials, freelance platforms


### Instructions:

**Understanding the Gap:**

From transcript:
- "We have only Yulia who knows [HTML], but we're not selling her"
- "HTML with tables" - tables are hardest part of email coding
- "Can give it to different guys" - need to identify WHO

**Solution Evaluation Matrix:**

| Solution | Cost | Time | Quality | Sustainability |
|----------|------|------|---------|----------------|
| AI Code Generation | $20/month | Hours | Good if reviewed | High (scalable) |
| Train Designers | Training time | Weeks | Variable | Medium (ongoing) |
| Use Developers | Salary | Days | Excellent | High (available) |
| Outsource | $50-100/task | Days | Excellent | Low (dependency) |
| LLM Specialists | Internal | Days | Good | Medium (capacity?) |

**Recommended Approach: Hybrid AI + Developer Review**

**Phase 1: Test AI Code Generation** (Today):

1. **Prepare Test**:
   - Take simple email newsletter design (can use existing mockup)
   - Create detailed prompt for AI

2. **Prompt Template**:
   ```
   I need to convert this email newsletter design to HTML code. Requirements:
   - Use HTML tables for layout (no div/flexbox/grid)
   - Include all CSS inline (no external stylesheets)
   - Make it responsive for mobile devices
   - Compatible with Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
   - Image placeholders with alt text
   - Clickable CTA buttons
   - 600px wide container

   [Paste design description or attach screenshot]
   ```

3. **Test with Multiple AIs**:
   - Chat GPT (team has subscription)
   - Gemini (mentioned as option)
   - Claude (if accessible)
   - Compare outputs

4. **Evaluate Results**:
   - Does code actually use tables?
   - Are styles inline?
   - Does it look like the design?
   - Are there obvious errors?
   - Rate quality: Excellent / Good / Needs Work / Unusable

**Phase 2: Developer Review Process** (If AI quality is "Good" or "Needs Work"):

1. **Brief Developers**:
   - Artem Skichko and/or Azar (new frontend developers)
   - Explain: Designers will use AI to generate HTML, developers review/fix
   - Estimate: 30-60 minutes per newsletter for review
   - Teach them email HTML specifics (if they don't know):
     * Table-based layouts
     * Inline CSS requirement
     * Email client quirks (Outlook uses Word rendering!)
     * Testing across clients

2. **Create Workflow**:
   ```
   Designer ’ Create design in Figma
      “
   Designer ’ Use AI to generate HTML
      “
   Developer ’ Review code (30-60 min)
      “
   Developer ’ Fix issues, optimize
      “
   Designer ’ Review final output
      “
   Test ’ Send to multiple email clients
      “
   Deliver ’ To client
   ```

3. **Document Process**:
   - Create simple guide for designers: "How to use AI for HTML email code"
   - Create checklist for developers: "Email HTML review checklist"
   - Save in shared folder

**Phase 3: Training (If needed for long-term):**

Only pursue if:
- AI + developer approach takes too long
- Volume of newsletters is very high (5/week = 20/month)
- Client continues beyond trial period

1. **HTML Email Basics Workshop** (4-6 hours):
   - Teach interested designers:
     * Why email HTML is different from web
     * Table-based layout fundamentals
     * Inline CSS technique
     * Common email client issues
     * Testing tools (Litmus, Email on Acid)
   - Provide practice exercises
   - Pair with developer for mentoring

2. **Select Designer(s) for Training**:
   - Whoever expresses interest
   - Ira Shinkevich (if she's assigned to this client)
   - 1-2 others as backup

**Phase 4: Implementation for This Project:**

**For Convenient Brands Test Assignment (This Week):**

1. **Tuesday**: Designer creates newsletter design
2. **Wednesday**: Designer uses AI to generate HTML (following guide)
3. **Wednesday afternoon**: Developer (Artem or Azar) reviews and fixes code
4. **Thursday**: Test email across clients, final adjustments
5. **Friday**: Deliver polished HTML newsletter

**Contingency Plans:**

If AI + Developer approach fails:
- **Plan B**: Hire freelance email HTML developer on Upwork ($50-100) for this one test
- **Plan C**: Use email template builder (Mailchimp, Beefree) to generate HTML
- **Plan D**: Deliver design only, explain HTML comes upon contract signing

**Long-term Strategy** (If client signs):

- **Week 1-2**: Use AI + developer review (proven method)
- **Week 3-4**: Train 1-2 designers on basics, reduce developer time
- **Month 2+**: Designers mostly independent, developer spot-checks
- **Goal**: Designers can handle 5 newsletters/week with minimal developer time

**Communication Plan:**

- **To Nastya**: "We're implementing AI-assisted HTML generation with developer review. This ensures quality while building team capability."
- **To Designers**: "We have a new workflow where AI helps you generate HTML code, and developers make sure it's perfect."
- **To Developers**: "We need your expertise to review AI-generated email HTML. This is a temporary support role, 30-60 min per project."
- **To Client** (if asked): "We use a combination of AI tools and developer expertise to create HTML email code that works perfectly across all email clients."

### Steps:
1. Review current status of both projects
2. Draft professional status inquiry messages for each client
3. Send inquiries today or tomorrow
4. Set follow-up reminders if no response within 24 hours
5. Based on responses, plan next steps for Bykova and Polina
6. Update project tracking documents
7. Reallocate resources if projects ending


### Resources and Links:
- Honeystone project: Bykova assigned, 1 week in, client status uncertain
- Data Mining project: Polina assigned, ending soon, possible 1-month extension
- Stas: Overloaded with website work for both
- Client contact information (from project files)


### Instructions:

**Current Situation Analysis:**

**Honeystone Project (Bykova):**
- Duration: 1 week so far
- Status: "In limbo" - client hasn't confirmed continuation
- Work: Stas making website, showing "some results today"
- Risk: Bykova could be waiting without billable work
- Need: Clear decision on project future

**Data Mining Project (Polina):**
- Duration: Ending imminently
- Status: "In limbo" - extension unknown
- Possible outcome: "Maybe another month, and that's it"
- Risk: Polina uncertain about next assignment
- Need: Confirmation if extending or ending

**Action Plan:**

**Step 1: Information Gathering** (Tuesday morning):

1. **Talk to Bykova**:
   - "How's the Honeystone project going?"
   - "Has client given feedback on Stas's work?"
   - "Are you getting regular assignments or waiting a lot?"
   - "Do you feel confident about project continuing?"

2. **Talk to Polina**:
   - "When does Data Mining contract officially end?"
   - "Has client mentioned extension?"
   - "Are you planning to write to them today/tomorrow?"
   - "What's your availability if this ends and new project starts?"

3. **Talk to Stas**:
   - "Prioritize: Bykova or Polina's website work?"
   - "How much time are you spending on each?"
   - "Do you need developer assistance from Artem/Azar?"
   - "When will Bykova's site be ready to show client?"

**Step 2: Client Communication** (Tuesday/Wednesday):

**Message Template for Honeystone Client:**

"Hi [Client Name],

Bykova has been working on the Honeystone project for one week now, and Stas has made good progress on the website with some initial results to show.

We'd like to schedule a brief check-in to:
1. Share the progress Stas has made
2. Get your feedback on the direction
3. Discuss next steps for the project

Are you available for a 15-30 minute call this week? We want to ensure we're aligned with your vision and timeline.

Best regards,
[Manager Name]"

**Why this approach:**
- Non-pushy but proactive
- Focuses on value (showing progress)
- Creates natural opportunity for client to confirm continuation
- If client enthusiastic: Project continues
- If client hesitant or no response: Warning sign to prepare for end

**Message Template for Data Mining Client:**

"Hi [Client Name],

As Polina's contract period approaches its conclusion, we wanted to check in regarding the project status.

Could you please let us know:
1. Are you satisfied with Polina's work?
2. Would you like to extend the engagement?
3. If extending, what would be the timeline and scope?

We want to ensure smooth continuity if you'd like to continue, or a proper wrap-up if the project is concluding.

Please let us know by [Thursday] so we can plan accordingly.

Thank you!

Best regards,
[Manager Name]"

**Why this approach:**
- Direct but professional
- Asks specific questions requiring specific answers
- Sets deadline for response (creates urgency)
- Prepared for either outcome (continue or end)

**Step 3: Response Analysis** (Wednesday/Thursday):

**If Honeystone Client Says "Yes, Continue":**
-  Confirm Bykova continues
-  Schedule regular check-ins (weekly)
-  Ensure Stas has time to support
-  Update project tracking: Status = Active

**If Honeystone Client is Vague or No Response:**
-   Follow up once more: "Just checking if you had a chance to consider..."
-   If still no clear answer by Friday: Assume ending
-   Prepare Bykova for transition: "Client may not continue"
-   Identify alternative projects for Bykova

**If Honeystone Client Says "No, Ending":**
-  Graceful conclusion: "Thank you for the opportunity..."
-  Request feedback for improvement
-  Ensure final payment processed
-  Make Bykova available for Convenient Brands or other projects

**If Data Mining Client Says "Yes, Extend 1 Month":**
-  Negotiate terms: Scope, rate, timeline
-  Sign extension agreement
-  Polina continues, plan for definite end date
-  Update project tracking: Status = Ending [Date]

**If Data Mining Client Says "No, Ending":**
-  Polina finishes current work professionally
-  Transition period: [End date]
-  Make Polina available immediately after: Could she start Convenient Brands?
-  Update project tracking: Status = Concluding

**Step 4: Resource Reallocation** (Thursday/Friday):

**If Both Projects End:**
- **Bykova**: Available for Convenient Brands email project or other assignments
- **Polina**: Available for new projects
- **Stas**: Workload reduced, can focus on highest priority

**If One Project Continues:**
- **Continuing project**: Ensure adequate support
- **Ending project**: Designer transitions to new work
- **Stas**: Continues supporting remaining project

**If Both Continue:**
- **Stas**: Definitely needs help from Artem or Azar
- **Evaluate**: Is Stas's workload sustainable for 2 websites?
- **Option**: Assign one website fully to new developer, Stas supervises

**Step 5: Documentation** (Ongoing):

Update project tracking spreadsheet/document:

| Project | Designer | Status | Client Decision | Next Steps | End Date |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Honeystone | Bykova | Pending | Awaiting response | Check-in call scheduled | TBD |
| Data Mining | Polina | Pending | Awaiting response | Extension inquiry sent | ~Nov 30? |
| Convenient Brands | TBD | Test Phase | Test by Friday | Assign designer(s) | TBD |
| Toribords | Marta | Active | Weekly check-ins | Negotiate 0.75 hours | Ongoing |

**Communication with Team:**

**Daily Standup Updates:**
- "Honeystone: Waiting for client response, should know by Thursday"
- "Data Mining: Polina reaching out to client, decision expected by [date]"
- "Convenient Brands: All hands on deck for Friday test assignment"

**Prepare Team Members:**
- **Bykova**: "Your project may end soon. We're checking. Meanwhile, you might move to email newsletter project."
- **Polina**: "Please reach out to client about extension. We need to know by Thursday to plan."
- **Stas**: "You're doing great juggling both. Help is available if needed from Artem/Azar."

## Task 5: Support Dasha Through Infrastructure Crisis


### Steps:
1. Assess Dasha's current situation and capabilities
2. Determine what work she can realistically do from mobile
3. Adjust her assignments to match her current limitations
4. Keep team informed of her availability and communication challenges
5. Provide support and flexibility during crisis
6. Monitor situation daily and adjust as conditions change
7. Plan for her return to full productivity when infrastructure restored


### Resources and Links:
- Dasha: Video editor, currently no electricity, water, flooded basement
- Working from mobile phone via CapCut
- Connection unstable, unreachable via Discord
- Phone calls only reliable communication method


### Instructions:

**Current Crisis Details:**

From transcript:
- **No electricity**: Until lunch minimum (possibly longer)
- **No water**: Can't flush toilets, sanitation issues
- **Flooded basement**: Serious property damage, safety concern
- **Communication**: Phone calls work, Discord/chat unreliable
- **Work capability**: Can edit videos on mobile phone (CapCut)
- **Location**: Similar conditions to "Donetsk" - likely Eastern Ukraine war zone

**Immediate Actions (Today):**

1. **Reach Out to Dasha** (via phone call):
   ```
   Script:
   "Hi Dasha, we heard about your situation with no power, water, and flooding. First, are you and your family safe? [Listen]

   We want to support you through this. What can you realistically do from your phone? What should we not assign to you right now?

   How can we help? Do you need us to:
   - Reduce your workload temporarily?
   - Give you only mobile-friendly tasks?
   - Adjust deadlines?
   - Something else?

   We're flexible. Your safety and wellbeing come first."
   ```

2. **Document Dasha's Capabilities During Crisis**:
   -  Can edit videos on phone (CapCut)
   -  Can do simple editing (cuts, transitions)
   -  Cannot do complex Adobe Premiere work (no laptop power)
   -  Cannot join Discord reliably
   -  Cannot attend video calls requiring professional setup
   - ? Can she work with audio? (Phone has good enough speakers?)
   - ? How many hours per day is realistic?

**Work Assignment Strategy:**

**DO Assign to Dasha:**
- Simple video edits that can be done on phone
- Tasks without tight deadlines
- Work that doesn't require client calls
- Projects where mobile editing is acceptable quality

**DON'T Assign to Dasha:**
- Convenient Brands project (American client, needs professional quality)
- Complex video editing requiring desktop software
- Anything requiring Discord collaboration
- Time-sensitive deliverables
- Client-facing video calls

**Alternative Arrangements:**

**Option 1: Temporary Leave**
- Suggest Dasha takes a few days off during crisis
- Pay her anyway or unpaid leave based on policy
- She focuses on handling flooding, water, power issues
- Returns when infrastructure restored

**Option 2: Reduced Hours/Flexible Schedule**
- She works when electricity is available
- Accepts whatever hours she can manage (2 hours? 4 hours?)
- Mobile-only tasks during outages
- Full work when power returns

**Option 3: Mobile-Specialist Role** (Current)
- She becomes the "mobile editing expert"
- Can teach team CapCut/mobile editing skills
- Handles projects that are mobile-appropriate
- Others handle desktop-required work

**Team Communication:**

**Update Team on Dasha's Situation:**
"Team update: Dasha is experiencing severe infrastructure issues (no power, water, flooding). She's safe but has very limited work capacity right now.

Current status:
- Available for: Simple video edits on mobile phone
- Not available for: Complex editing, Discord collaboration, client calls
- Communication: Phone calls only, connection unreliable
- Timeline: Situation may improve soon, or could last days/weeks

Please DO NOT assign her:
- Convenient Brands work
- Anything deadline-critical
- Tasks requiring laptop/desktop software

She's doing her best in difficult circumstances. Let's support her."

**Client Management:**

**If Dasha was Assigned to American Client:**
- DO NOT put her on Convenient Brands project
- Her situation (no power, mobile-only) not compatible with American client expectations
- American client is "talkative," wants conversation - Dasha can barely connect
- Assign someone else (Ira Shinkevich suggested as option)

**If Dasha Has Current Client Projects:**
- Assess: Can these be handled from mobile? Or need reassignment?
- Communicate to clients (if necessary): "Due to infrastructure issues in Ukraine, we're temporarily adjusting the team. [New person] will be handling this."
- Don't give clients all the details (floods, no water) - unprofessional and concerning
- Keep it simple: "Technical difficulties, resolving soon"

**Support and Empathy:**

**What Dasha Needs from Team:**

1. **Flexibility**: Don't pressure her for standard productivity
2. **Understanding**: War zone infrastructure failures aren't her fault
3. **Reduced expectations**: Mobile editing ` desktop quality
4. **Communication patience**: If she's hard to reach, it's not laziness
5. **Practical support**: Maybe team can cover some costs? (See below)

**Financial Support Options:**

**Company Could Consider:**
- Pay for generator rental (~$50-100/day)
- Pay for coworking space (if available in her city - probably not)
- Pay for hotel with power/water for a few days ($30-50/night)
- Give her advance on salary to handle emergency expenses
- Send emergency supplies if possible

**However**: Transcript doesn't indicate company offering this. May not be policy. But worth suggesting to management if Dasha is valuable team member.

**Daily Monitoring:**

**Check-in Schedule:**
- **Every morning**: Call Dasha to ask about power/water status
- **Document**: Note when power is available, her planned work hours
- **Adjust**: Shift her tasks based on daily capability
- **Encourage**: "You're doing great under difficult circumstances"

**Status Updates to Track:**

| Date | Power Status | Water Status | Work Hours | Tasks Completed | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Nov 11 | No until lunch | No | 0-2 hours? | TBD | Flooded basement |
| Nov 12 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Check morning |

**Long-term Solutions:**

If infrastructure crisis persists:

1. **Temporary Relocation**:
   - Can Dasha go to friend/family with better conditions?
   - Can she relocate to another city temporarily?
   - Cost: Travel, accommodation - who pays?

2. **Equipment Investment**:
   - Power bank/battery stations (mentioned in previous daily logs)
   - Generator
   - Starlink internet (if power available)
   - Cost: $300-1000 - company investment?

3. **Role Adjustment**:
   - Maybe Dasha does work that doesn't require consistent uptime
   - Content strategy, planning, research vs. hands-on editing
   - Or she transitions off team temporarily

**What NOT to Do:**

-  Don't pressure her to "just make it work"
-  Don't assign her critical client work
-  Don't express frustration about her limitations
-  Don't compare her situation to others ("Dasha, Maria found a cafe...")
-  Don't make her feel like a burden

**What TO Do:**

-  Express concern for her safety and wellbeing
-  Ask how you can help
-  Adjust expectations and assignments
-  Be patient with communication difficulties
-  Appreciate whatever work she CAN do
-  Keep checking in (she may feel isolated/forgotten)

**Possible Silver Lining:**

- Dasha knows mobile editing (CapCut)
- She could create "Mobile Video Editing Guide" for team
- Useful for: Quick edits, TikTok/Reels content, emergency situations
- Could be a training contribution even while unable to do full work

**Priority: Human Before Worker**

Remember: Dasha is dealing with:
- No way to bathe (no water)
- No way to cook (no power, maybe no water for cleanup)
- No way to use toilet normally (no water to flush)
- Possible property damage from flooding
- Living in active war zone with infrastructure attacks
- Trying to work professionally while managing all this

Be kind. Be flexible. Support her however possible.
