**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[After the trial period, they're still unhappy with her. Then the funny thing was, it turns out Yulia talked with her yesterday, and Yulia sent her the transcription of the call with them when they were communicating. And the funny thing is that on the project, these co-workers of theirs, they're asking, "What about Brooke, how's Brooke?" And the funny thing is that they themselves refused him, they said he's too smart, they don't know what work to give him.

And then one manager asked another manager, "How's Brooke?" and he says, "I don't know, I'm waiting," he says, "for a response from the company." Kolya, basically, offered them three trial workers for a whole week for free - they offered Ira, Eleonora, and Brooke, free for a week. And they refused, they said we don't need them.

Not even for free. And now they think it's Ira. Yes, now they decided that we're the ones holding them up, they realized that, like, they need Brooke.

I say, well, tell them I don't know, that he was sold or something, well really. I honestly doubt that he'll work really well. Or there will be such an option that he'll just work directly with this... With Mosik.

With Mosik, yes. Well, basically, these people are strange. She said, Kolya, she already told him about this, they agreed with Kolya.

Only, basically, Kolya reacted adequately, he already understood that this client is not quite adequate. So, problematic, so to speak. And this, it also turned out that for the Toribords project, they raised the price, although he said, like, let's reduce it, they still left the same price, like, it was, or reduced it slightly.

I said that he now wrote, I'll drop you the message, that with Marta, that he'll now use her skills, well, like, to create these videos that they need. And Nastya says we'll need to negotiate with him so that he at least takes Marta, maybe at least at 0.75, as an option. So.

And she says they have a call with him tomorrow. I say, wait, what's the point of a call for tomorrow, we seem to have already decided everything with him. And Nastya said that they'll now call every week and ask how things are going.

Clients. Clients, so, with this storyboard. So the question.

Now we have two more projects in limbo. This is Honeystone, which Bykova is working on, well, who's already been working with us for a week, basically. And the same limbo state with Polina, with the Data Mining project.

She'll be writing to this client today or tomorrow, finding out what and how, because either we're extending or not extending, how much is left there at all. But most likely, even if we extend, maybe another month or so, and that's it. It seems like Stas really took on making the website for Nastya Bykova.

So, she said that there are already some results today. But now Stas needs to do work for Polina too. That is, another job piled on top of him.

So Bykova and Polina are questionable. And on Friday she sent me, now I'll probably drop this info in chat. They asked to do a test assignment "Will there be a client?".

So, this is probably chat, probably design admin. Throwing what they made for me. Basically, what they asked us to make admin.

There's going to be a call planned with an American company. Here, by the way, I dropped their website, haven't visited yet, convenient brands. And below what I dropped, this is a call from the client.

She needs a designer, as Nastya explained to me, haven't really read what's written yet. Officially she needs a designer to create email newsletters. I think email newsletters aren't complicated, so... And for UX designers this should be a piece of cake.

Because it's even easier than placing a website. Yes, this email newsletter, she has, like, inside her company there are five more companies. And she needs to make five of these newsletters each week, not each day.

Ideally, of course, she needs a candidate who knows HTML code so that, I understand, they can code all this. And through some Zoho application, like this site, I don't know what it is. Yes, you could say, like, like MailChimp or there are other things that make this... The website design itself they make as... Like you make a newsletter design, then you stuff this email newsletter into the chat itself.

It seems she said about this client from America that she's such a nice woman. She says that in half an hour... The only thing is she has real American English, she speaks very fast. I, she says, even made a mistake myself.

But, she says, in half an hour of a call with her, she says, she managed to tell her about her dog, and showed it to her, and everything. That is, very talkative, that she'll need to talk. This is like an option where Ira might fit, maybe, there, this Shinkevich.

But the only thing is that there might be a problem that... Well, like, either in the second half of the day, well, it's unknown. Because she wants one specialist who would be a designer who knows HTML. But we don't have such people who could code all this.

And my newsletter won't work. We have only Yulia who knows, but we're not selling her. So, basically, this one... We don't have options who would know HTML.

I said that either then ask the LLM people or the developers. We just hired two anyway. Someone could deal with them just right.

Because I looked here, what I dropped the document. There, basically, it says "specialist experienced in HTML, email format, using tables." And tables are really hard to code.

This isn't even like a picture. Pretty difficult. Here it also depends on what kind of tables there will be, what will be there, I don't know.

And there's also this Zoho that you need to master. And she asked to make some test option for them, a newsletter for this Zoho company, for the guys. Basically, do deep research on this Zoho.

See if it's realistic... Watch some videos. What else, is it realistic to learn this Zoho. Can give someone the task to do this deep research on Zoho, then they'll tell us what they came to.

So that, for example, they try to make that same new newsletter in this Zoho, if there are free trial versions there, options for something. We'll show this to the client when they make it for themselves. No-no, we'll show Zoho to the client.

Well, basically, such an option that she asked to do deep research, this is for us and for the client purely to test the Zoho platform. But definitely what we'll show the client is the email newsletter. That is, how the guys will make it.

One, one email newsletter is enough, as a test assignment. And maybe the email newsletter can really be made so that like there's HTML through some AI, like there Gemini, code, ask, there in principle, so it gives HTML code, then we'll basically replace this part, the HTML won't be needed there anymore. But I don't know, see, if there's a table, then you need to mess around to change all this.

Well, basically, our task is to try to create an email newsletter so it's HTML right away, and test what this Zoho is. See if we can, can't, what to do. Can give it to different guys.

You can even, as an option, give someone Deep Research. Make some quick email newsletter and try to stuff it into Zoho. And give the rest, for example, just, whoever has less time, just make one email newsletter each so that by Friday we already have it ready.

That is, we have 4 days left for all this. And about Zoho they'll just tell us, test it, and we'll understand when problems will arise. Because we have the most experience there, probably with HTML, we need to give so they test this Zoho and upload the newsletter.

Will it work or not. About Zoho I warned Nastya that most likely it's unlikely to work out for us because we don't really know HTML. That is, we'll make the design, we can, as a test.

But about Zoho I'm not sure. She asked to do Deep Research and still try to upload it there if there are opportunities, attempts and so on. That is, we'll need to make a task about this Zoho then.

I've talked so much already. Are there any references to this Zoho? Because I see that only some stores are showing up for me, not something else. I don't know, I found some kind of Zoho.

Now I'll drop it if I found the right one. I dropped it in the chat here, the link. Mail is written there it seems.

I decided it's it, but I didn't really read into it. Business email for organization, seems like it. But I'm not sure, yes.

I understand Nastya also hardly knows anything about it. Zoho creator, what? Maybe Zoho creator. I found only this Zoho, yes.

Need to read this thing that Nastya dropped in chat, I didn't even read it. There, basically, here's another funny thing. She needs to see what's needed.

The client she made here. A specialist who has experience in HTML with Zoho tables. Then 5 of these email newsletters each week.

One for each company. Additional, what else is needed. She needs to generate images in AI.

We all know how to do this. Light graphics, graphic designer work. I don't know, maybe this meant generating images.

There's light graphic work. And most importantly, there's video content here. Video content that needs to be made, that's what I said, I suggest the client this video editor.

Because even to stuff a video into an email newsletter, you need to create it first. It still needs to be edited. If it's more than one scene, it still needs to be edited.

If an automator is needed, let them decide from us. It only depends on the design. We'll make it, right? Because a lot relates to us.

PDF documents too. What to write in the newsletter? What's on her website, on the content side. I don't know.

Let's see now. I haven't even looked yet. What kind of company, what does it do.

Now about the buckets. And look, Dasha has... She has no light now. She won't have light until lunch.

And the basements flooded too. It's a disaster there. And no water.

Just like in Donetsk. What's left? Gas for now. All that's left is to clog the sewage.

If there's no water, it'll clog. This is our joke. No water, nothing to flush with.

People are to blame for the sewage getting clogged. Like Makar. She's there now... Sorting out the situation.

She edits on her phone. The only thing is her connection drops. I can only reach her by phone.

She said she'll be editing. But there's almost no connection with her. It's unrealistic to catch her through Discord.

She logged in there. I'll be hanging there. But not a fact that she won't get kicked out.

If with a client, then it's tense now. With a client. She has to work there, just Americans.

Maybe it would be fine for her. The main thing is that the person has electricity. No connection, nothing.

And work. Maybe someone will fit. Maybe ours will manage.

It's a shame that Dasha brought her mobile phone. So she could give us a master class on how to edit videos in CapCut. Dragged in CapCut.

Lined up in one line. Turned on transitions between them. Oh well.

In CapCut and YouTube. It's just awesome. Some primitive skills.

Now Adobe Premiere updated. A beta version came out. They added all sorts of interesting features there.

Conveniences. Finally updated transitions after 10 years. Is it free? Paid.

They now made different actions. All this is done through Adobe's server. Like in Photoshop.

You need some effect to be calculated. It goes to the server once. To artificial intelligence.

40 dollars for a subscription should be given as a plus to everyone immediately. Expensive. Even clients say it's expensive.

One subscription costs 40 dollars per program. Runway costs 100 dollars. Besides Runway you need several image generators.

Need to grab Gemini. Chat GPT. That's another princess.

Maybe also 20 dollars. 100-150 bucks by default. Even 200.

This is basically just for programs. Without which there's no way at all. 200 dollars like that, and then just salary.

Nastya said that for this in Astoria Boards. Nastya knows that for Marta she'll use a subscription that costs 100 dollars. She'll use Chat GPT separately and everything else that also costs money.

I understand that they need to raise the price in general. Otherwise they're all so cunning. So that's it.

I don't know. I was telling, it turns out our Vika, the recruiter, will be leaving. The recruiter? Yeah.]




**Outcomes:**
- **Toribords/Brooke situation**: Client still wants Brooke after initially refusing him; Kolya aware client is problematic; Marta's hours may increase to 0.75 for video work; weekly check-ins scheduled
- **Projects in limbo identified**: Honeystone (Bykova - 1 week in) and Data Mining (Polina - ending soon, maybe 1 month extension max)
- **New American client opportunity**: Convenient Brands needs HTML email newsletter designer (5 newsletters/week, one per company division)
- **Test assignment requirements defined**:
  - Create 1 email newsletter as test (deadline: Friday, 4 days)
  - Do deep research on Zoho platform
  - Test if HTML code can be generated via AI (Gemini) and uploaded to Zoho
  - Additional needs: AI image generation, light graphics, video content, PDF documents
- **Staffing challenges**: No designers know HTML coding; only Yulia but she's not available; may need developers/LLM specialists
- **Dasha's crisis**: No electricity until lunch, flooded basement, no water - working from mobile phone with poor connection
- **Adobe costs discussion**: Premiere beta with AI features costs $40/month; total subscriptions (Runway $100, Chat GPT $20, image generators) = $150-200+
- **HR change**: Recruiter Vika leaving the company

## Notes
- **Critical deadline**: Friday (November 15) for Convenient Brands test assignment - only 4 days remaining
- **Technical gap**: Team lacks HTML email coding skills; need to involve developers or use AI code generation
- **Platform research needed**: Zoho platform is unknown - requires deep research and testing
- **Infrastructure issues**: Eastern Ukraine continues to suffer severe power/water outages affecting Dasha's ability to work with clients
- **Client relationship concerns**: Toribords client showing difficult behavior but project continuing with adjustments
- **Resource allocation issue**: Stas now overloaded with both Bykova and Polina's website work
- **Uncertain projects**: Two projects (Honeystone, Data Mining) need status confirmation this week
