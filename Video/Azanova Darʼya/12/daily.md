**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Hello. Honestly, I was born in fantasy, pressing the card and throwing it in. She says, what is this, what is this? This Chronicle Bot, damn.

What is this? What kind of Chronicle Bot? I still don't know what Chronicle Bot is. I don't know. The one that wrote yesterday, I don't really understand, is there some kind of call today or what, I don't really understand either, yes.

They're with Artemchuk, I wanted to call Artemchuk then to have him explain. It's there... In the admin they're writing all kinds of stuff, all kinds of things. Yes, basically, Sveta, I saw a message yesterday about the fact that I don't really understand, there's a call today, or maybe it's not a call, or what it is, he just distributed some tasks, yes.

So. First of all, they're going to introduce a bot that will check in Discord how much time you sat in the channels. When you logged in, when you left.

Also they want, basically, now they're introducing strict verification of time tracking and attachment of screenshots, accounting will introduce this, in connection with these power outages. So. And what this bot is, I don't know yet.

And now there's also this some kind of bot, I don't really understand, today we only have a call at 11, or maybe we don't have it, yes. Nothing is clear. Kolya here, Kolya, I understand, is not in a great mood today, because I left yesterday around the beginning of two, and he was sitting in the channel.

And he hasn't gone to sleep since the beginning of two. I don't know. That's his business, Kazan procrastination.

I don't understand what he's writing here. Now I'll ask Artemchuk. They also published it like everyone should immediately understand what this is.

It looks different for everyone. No, no, just the very fact of what this is and so on. Something red, something critical, high priority, ongoing, production operations one.

I'll read the convolution, because for Villi the earliest they scheduled him for an 11 o'clock call. And where can you see this? And there's also a time set until some hour. Look here, at the bottom Wednesday 16:01 hour.

This is, in my opinion, we called, what this is, it's unclear. Everything is written there about what needs to be said. Well yes, that's why I don't know.

Well, they pulled this, I understand, from our reports. Yes, it's clear that this is generated. Projects, infrastructure, work processes.

Maria Glushko, power outage, determine infrastructure support options, coworking, obtaining main client feedback. But I said all this. We already solved this problem.

Checking Maria Glushko's project. Schedule immediate client check. Work completed without feedback.

This problem was also already solved. Research of Zoho platform. We only just started this.

Complete research, testing companies for new client. Basically, based on our reports it pulled out some nonsense, and that's it. Black Friday company, high priority this week.

What high priority? I didn't say this was high priority. Okay, this week like create 3 days free for advertising. Prepare for negotiations with Mosik about increasing Marta's rate.

Is the robot writing something? Based on our reports? It's not Mosik working on the project, it's Storyboards. Replacement is me, that's clear. Data Mining in connection with the client for more precise project scope expansion.

Polina's contract will complete all work by the 13th. Pass to developers that she won't make it. We already discussed this.

Standard mascots the same thing. She will provide design system analysis in honor of comments received after review. Strictly defined colors, missing components.

Tool setup, accessibility. Migration from Adobe Firefly Pro and Dropbox for all designers. Well okay, Dropbox, clear, migration.

And where with Adobe Firefly? What migration? Frequency of communication with client. Incorrect circumstances related to inclusion in electronic. Basically, about nothing.

Some nonsense. Well, I counted Villi's. And now I'll count yours approximately.

Critical. Infrastructure, training. First, training video about file system.

You just somehow, you know, it didn't work out. It should be like everyone else's. This greenish, yellowish variation.

So, I also have greenish, yellowish, reddish here. This is critical. Only for everyone, you know, it's made nicely.

Like from a new line. You have everything in a row. Yes.

Just there's some kind of event from above. You see, it's written more. Video operating review from 17 to 18.

I like it. And the finance department will be from 18 to 19 at all. So, okay.

Counted Villi's. It's clear that nothing is clear for you. Training video about file system.

What is this? Basically, complete editing and provide to lead generators for adaptation. What training video are you making? What training video? Leave checklists from more than 8 upcoming CRM videos, OpenAI, creation of free production. Transportation impact problems, power outage, assessment of captives and employees, coordinate infrastructure support with finance department, eco-flow, coworking.

And you see, they're proposing. Yes. Production process optimization, analysis of human places connected with power outages and development of clear procedures.

Client notifications about delays, client video process performance, balanced work completion deadlines with clients as main priority, functional tasks, use of video tools, effectiveness analysis of advanced practices for Runway, hygiene synthesis, video production standards ensuring standard quality system, subtitles sound optimization level platform, key verification process 18-step, video production workflow when creating training video, workflow tools integration and response protocol to given circumstances client interactions. Nothing is clear? Basically. And yours is even worse than what you saw.

This robot is making something up, something there based on what we talked about somewhere somehow, made up some nonsense. How? Like came up with a plan. So should we pull Dasha out now or not, warn her about this, about power outages from sitting in Discord.

I was just about to go to her, and she disconnected. She was just sitting, and now she appeared again. Yes, it's so nice to hear.

Considering that they didn't make this folder for her yesterday for the eleventh day, I sat and made the folder and made a separate report based on my conversations. And there was a separate need. Now they'll create all the folders inside themselves.

Yes? Yes, Kolya said, Artemchuk, that all folders inside Discord, Dropbox, are created independently and actually add these three template files here. Every day we create a folder for ourselves and add our three reports there. Someone got tired of doing this, right? Kolya wanted Artemchuk to do this, but Nikkar told him that like I won't bother anyone in the frame, like let them do it themselves, so there won't be empty folders either.

He likes it when empty folders are like created and immediately filled. So, Dasha, I'm telling you, something is being planned there, Svetushka said, about there will be like a flexible schedule, yes, will be in connection with power outages, but with verification of hours worked. Now they'll implement a bot in Discord, how much you sat in chats, when you logged in, whether your login matches with CRM and so on.

And plus the same thing they'll strictly check, most likely they'll add more screenshots to the CRM system. Yes. Just to be aware.

While they're still at the implementation stage, I don't know, but they'll check both login and logout, basically, when we left and all this. Okay. The main thing is that there are 8 hours and work is done, right? Yes, the main thing is that there are 8 hours.

The only thing, at least the plus in all this, is that they apparently allowed us flexible schedules, because for the guys, some have everything okay, but mainly those in the east, everyone has some problems with this electricity. So. The worst situation for them.

And the most important thing is that the work is completed, screenshots are attached, accordingly, and this right now, if new bots come out, there will either be more screenshots, or there will also be some bot in Discord that will watch who worked how much, when they logged in, when they left and so on. That is, basically, you'll need to track, actually, time will now be both in Discord and in Timetracker. Ok.

Uh-huh. We're informing you. But they're still at the development stage, all this.

That is, it's unknown how it will be. It's also written there, need to talk with Olya, or what they've reached. I don't know with Olya, but... So.

So, in this way. This is what we wanted to say. And also, Dasha, there's a new client coming up.

Yesterday there was a new client, some woman from America. And she'll need like videos. She has there, I understand, some kind of her own company, and she does email newsletters.

And, possibly, most likely, she'll need there, like, to insert some video into this email newsletter. Or maybe she'll need some videos. So.

If anything, we'll call you to Design. Okay, if needed, then okay. Well we don't know, like she generally wanted a designer who would do all this, but if suddenly, that is, like it's unknown what she needs there in this video.

That without a video editor it's impossible, right. Well, okay. And who else is there? Yes, you're doing video interviews there? Well, yesterday I finished what I have here, yes.

This thing, how is it? Basically, finished yesterday's. Non-Russian. Neritovsk girl.

Ah, that Alicia. There you need to... He wrote to me that they've been waiting since August for some young lady. Ah, I also saw, yes.

And the fact that we asked them for a list back in September, when we were compiling here. And she wasn't there. What's most interesting, she wasn't on the list.

Yes, give us on the list. They only just put her on, I understand. Do you want, I'll tell you although she seems to be standing she seems to be standing since August but she's first in line.

How could we have missed her? Standing where? They've been waiting since August for us to make her a video. Yes, let's eliminate. Yesterday they attacked us in chat.

We've been waiting since August, where's the new joiner video. Did they go crazy or what? We went by the table, made all the videos. Yes, and we can't get an employee list from them, neither new joiners nor anyone.

How long can it be? We've been fighting for two months, nothing at all. We already double-checked this list 10 thousand times. And now they we've been waiting since August.

They wrote like that. And we're also waiting already how long for a list from you specifically, so we can cross-reference everything in a unified table. And no one provides it to us.

If they had at least written we've been waiting since August, we could have just gone in and said, like, guys, you probably forgot about the video, please make it, and there would be no questions. And instead straight up, we've actually been waiting since August. We're also waiting for super good candidates for 300 dollars, so they would edit motion design there, do everything else.

How long are we waiting? Already since the company's foundation we're waiting. And also to work overtime and so on.

And with all the AIs.

And be super specialists. And with all the nerves. Yes, yes, yes.

Also waiting. And we're waiting for the list. We won't get candidates together anymore, but we're waiting for the list, waiting.

And how much they made us, we already redid this list with Artemchuk two or three times for these reports. Basically, we'll probably need to make that young lady, so they don't cry there. Well okay, but we checked with you, remember, last week.

We sat, roughly speaking, manually. Checked everyone by numbers. Moreover, it turns out half of them already haven't worked for a long time, although they were listed.

About 10 people haven't worked for ages. Well yes. It turns out, there's still not everyone there.

You know, others' mistakes are always noticed better than your own. In this case it's easier to blame than to do. That's why.

Exactly the same as with me. Urgently, urgently make this Dalmatians, there was something like that. My power already doesn't work yesterday.

Dinochka. Come on. Dovladdadova.

Okay, understood. Dovladdodova, yes. Chipolina doesn't work, Dovladdodova doesn't work.

Chipolina, yes. Most interestingly, her name is Nastich Polina. We call her Nastich and Polina.

She's actually called differently. We call her Nastich and Polina. It sounds so funny to me.

To me. According to the schedule I should have no power now, and my power should cut out right now. I have no power.

Three times a day. You have a tablet, right. Yes, I have a tablet, but still it feels like it's not the same.

I somehow cleverly figured something out here. Someone threw some wire somewhere. Well, if I suddenly disappear.

So, like, you don't mind that my visa turned off. Yes, I want to talk more with these. And do we have many guys here who are in Ukraine, do they have all this turned off? Well, in our department for some reason it somehow turned out that we have you and we have one more girl from Dnipropetrovsk region, Kamenskaya, I think, too.

Oh, one girl, apparently. Oh, they have a complete disaster, disaster, disaster there. Yes, but with him... She's also working on a project.

Well, she needs to be simpler then, probably, although... The rest of us Leonora is in Germany, Irina is in the Netherlands, our other girl you worked with, Polina, she's in Austria with us. So... There it's normal. And I can hear Yulia, when she starts talking, you can hear people around talking.

Are you sitting in a cafe somewhere? Me? No. No, not you, it's the second Yulia. Ah, no.

Yulia, maybe, yes, I don't know. My, well, microphone was off, and now I'm, yes, in a cafe. No, I just hear that you have... Yes.

No, we're normal. Yes, everything's good. Just, turns out, I live with my friend, she also has remote work, and she has a very important call there.

It'll sound at ours, if such calls overlap, some through hands, we're one in one. Here's a quiet hotel, I have a cafe under my house. Yes.

Yes, we also have Bykova Nastya, same thing, she's somewhere in Western Ukraine, ah, by the way, I don't know, she's in Odessa, she said, it's normal there. Well, judging by what's happening in Odessa. That's already a complete catastrophe there.

Well, in principle, people have already adapted to everything. Well, still, when it turns off, you still sit, so what should I do? Well, such, of course, it slows everything down a bit, everything's a bit like this. But then, of course, when the power turns on, too.

They turned on the power? There was no power from 11 am to 6 pm. At half past six they turned on the power, at 9 they turned it off. What was I supposed to manage to do in this time? Not do laundry, not wash dishes.

Ah, also we have, basically, yesterday these, turns out, we have, well, something there, basically, in the basement, I don't know, was going, basically, something there, leaking somewhere, in the basement there's water up to the knee. Like, water is standing. And because of this they turned off the water.

And yesterday we had this, even though they turned on the power, and we had there a bit more time between outages, there, well, 3-4 hours, well, but we sat without water. So you say you won't do laundry, nothing, and then they turned on the water, and in 20 minutes they turned off the power. Well, and, naturally, again the water.

Well, basically, could just live, as they say, well. Well, you'll laugh, but I have... But you still complained. Gas is the only thing that's left.

Listen, I have... Well, we have, thank God, well, we have, what is this, we did renovation, we have in the kitchen this from spark. But there's no spark. So we, like the good old days, a match, and Vadik, and you wait, and that's it.

And I have a different joke. Did I tell you how my valiant cat caught a mouse? And yesterday Vika came home, my opens the trash can, how she screams, another mouse. Well, the cat somehow weakly played, but caught this mouse himself.

Well, and not arriving, just caught with gloves there, basically. Interesting, where are they coming from for you? Threw out from the balcony. Want a joke? Vika, well, already late evening opens the trash can, doesn't scream anymore.

She says, Svyat, there's another one sitting there. She says, it just darted away, ran off. No, they climb through... through the riser, through the pipes.

Well, imagine, if this is already the third one, then, excuse me, there's already one sixth. God, we still lack wild mice, Lord. Well, basically, in general, my cat was on duty all night, I don't know what he was doing there.

Well, good job. But didn't catch mice. He urgently needs to get a second one.

He at least scared them away, you know, with his scary appearance. For mice. So, here, basically, we need this favor... Timilolu... Timilolua favor.

Favor Timilolua. Is she Zimbabwe for someone... Aw, bubon! Is she for someone Zimbabwe coming to us, or what? Nigeria, probably, some, I don't know. Basically, she's also presale, she's presale.

Presale manager. Personnel assistant. So she, means, works like a manager at Rozhavenky, right? Yes.

I'll throw her into the table first of all, or what, let her be. And I this, basically, was in Lviv. That's all days.

And what? Does anyone even know there what about power outages? Nothing. Everyone lives their beautiful wonderful life. We lived there, there was, basically, water, and heating, and power, and internet, and connection.

Generally it was wonderful there. Great. And then, naturally, I was struck by only two moments from all this.

Well, first, I didn't hear, because well, it was a festival, and I kids, basically, did with kids. If anything, the biggest task was to have her make a design system for that website. Ah, design system for that website.

Look at what stage it's at. Indicator, of course, won't make it, so, as an option. Design system.

So, and we still need to resolve with Nastya pulling here, probably, because we need to decide what's there with Polina, because she has a day off today. Nastya, remember, we cruelly removed you from your workplace. What's there with Polina, with the Data Mining project? Anything known? Because she's only working on it today and tomorrow.

I don't remember anything. Wrote. Yes, not visible yet.

We have some call now. Did you know that today there are calls all day in every department? I knew, yes. Because they told me so.

We have questions about Polina standing there. Polina is at work. She was yesterday.

We don't really know anything that she's there... Yesterday argued, today the situation could have influenced. I don't know anything. Before that we still need to connect Stas about this website.

I almost didn't catch him yesterday. When it will be possible to catch him today, I don't know. At least, we'll still do feedback, all this.

We generally agreed with him about a call yesterday, but at 11 he had something, I proposed to him 3 o'clock. He ghosted me. But I wrote today.

First time I feel this way. Maybe they did it accidentally? Well, maybe, I don't know. We won't find out for good.

You also have such a story. Because for now, you have chaos in folders. Well, okay then.

About the client I'm not really aware. What's there with the website? He only worked on the presentation. She worked on it full-time.

And wouldn't even have reached the presentation. To add, what are his main needs. In principle, she said normally, adequately.

He didn't say anything there. She liked, in principle, the client.]


**Outcomes:**
- **Chronicle Bot Implementation**: New AI bot generating automated project summaries with mixed accuracy - team confused by inconsistent formatting and some incorrect information (solved problems marked as current, wrong project names like "Mosik" instead of "Storyboards", incorrect priorities)
- **Discord Time Tracking Bot**: New system being implemented to monitor login/logout times in Discord channels, verify 8-hour workdays, and cross-reference with CRM/Timetracker - still in development stage
- **Flexible Schedule Policy**: Company allowing flexible work hours due to power outages, but requiring strict time verification through enhanced CRM screenshots and Discord bot tracking
- **Alicia Video Interview Crisis**: Client complaint - waiting since August for Alicia's (Timilolua Favor) video; she wasn't on original list provided in September; team verified list 10+ times; client now blaming team despite not providing complete employee list
- **Polina's Data Mining Project**: Contract ending November 13th (tomorrow) - status unclear, no recent communication from Nastya about extension or conclusion
- **Convenient Brands New Client**: American woman client needs email newsletters, possibly requiring video content - opportunity for Dasha
- **Infrastructure Challenges**: Eastern Ukraine team (Dasha, Maria, Kamenskaya in Dnipropetrovsk region) experiencing severe power outages 3x daily, flooded basements, water shutoffs; Western team (Leonora-Germany, Irina-Netherlands, Polina-Austria) unaffected
- **Folder Management Change**: Team now self-creates daily folders with three template files instead of admin creating them
- **Stas Coordination**: Attempted to reach Stas for website feedback - he ghosted the 3pm call; need to follow up
- **Design System Progress**: Website design system in progress, uncertain if it will be completed on time

---

## Notes
- **Chronicle Bot concerns**: Team finding AI-generated summaries inaccurate and confusing - some items are outdated problems already solved, project names wrong, priorities incorrectly assigned
- **Critical client relations issue**: Alicia video interview complaint highlights ongoing struggle to get complete employee lists from clients - team has requested lists multiple times since September with no response, yet client blames team for delays
- **Infrastructure crisis escalating**: Eastern Ukraine experiencing severe conditions (no power 11am-6pm, water shutoffs, flooded basements) - team members working from cafes, using tablets, managing 3x daily outages
- **Polina project deadline tomorrow**: Uncertainty about Data Mining project extension creates resource planning challenges - need immediate clarification
- **Time tracking changes ahead**: New Discord bot will monitor work hours more strictly while allowing flexible schedules - balance between flexibility and accountability
- **Folder management now self-service**: Team members create own daily folders with three template files to avoid empty folders and reduce admin workload
- **Stas unavailable**: Couldn't connect for website feedback - ghosted 3pm call, unclear when he'll be available
- **New client opportunity**: Convenient Brands may provide additional video work for team
- **Team morale note**: Frustration evident about being blamed for client's own list management failures while team has been "waiting since company foundation" for ideal candidates at $300 rates

## Reminder
- Whisper Flow ON during all activities
- Update this file throughout the day
- Include all meeting transcripts
