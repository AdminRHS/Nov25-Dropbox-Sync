Yes / No\n\n**Relationship:**\n- Is Iris responsive to reasonable requests? _______\n- Does Iris respect work hour boundaries? _______\n- Are complaints legitimate or fabricated? _______\n- Trust level: High / Medium / Low / None\n\n**Staff:**\n- Is Natasha comfortable continuing? _______\n- Does this affect Natasha's wellbeing? _______\n- Could Natasha be placed with better client? _______\n\n**Next Steps - 3 Day Plan:**\n\n**Day 1 (Today - November 10):**\n```\n☐ Document all communication from past week\n☐ Screenshot all reports Natasha sent\n☐ Note Iris's non-responses\n☐ Check with Natasha: \"How do you feel about this client?\"\n☐ Review contract: Notice period, termination terms\n```\n\n**Day 2 (November 11):**\n```\n☐ If Iris hasn't responded: Send professional check-in\n   \"Hi Iris, Natasha sent reports on Friday. Did you receive them?\n    Please confirm everything is on track. Thanks!\"\n☐ Continue normal work (don't escalate yet)\n☐ Document any response or continued silence\n```\n\n**Day 3 (November 12):**\n```\n☐ If still no response: Management decision meeting\n☐ Review financials, relationship health, staff preference\n☐ Make decision: Continue with new terms, or exit gracefully\n```\n\n**Day 4 (November 13):**\n```\n☐ Implement decision\n☐ If continuing: Send new communication protocol\n☐ If exiting: Send professional notice\n```\n\n**New Communication Protocol (if continuing):**\n\n\"Hi Iris,\n\nTo ensure clear communication going forward, let's establish a simple protocol:\n\n**Natasha's Work Hours:** 12:00-16:00 Irish time, Monday-Friday\n\n**Daily Check-ins:**\n- Morning: Natasha will message \"Starting work\" at 12:00\n- Evening: Natasha will message \"Finished for today\" at 16:00\n\n**Work Updates:**\n- Natasha will send end-of-day summary each day\n- You can review and provide feedback anytime\n- For urgent matters during work hours, ping on [communication channel]\n\n**Response Times:**\n- During work hours: Within 15 minutes\n- Outside work hours: Next business day\n\nDoes this work for you?\n\nBest regards,\n[Manager]\"\n\n**Graceful Exit Script (if ending):**\n\n\"Hi Iris,\n\nAfter careful consideration, we've decided this working arrangement isn't the best fit for either of us.\n\nWe'll complete the current work cycle through [date], giving you [X days] notice to find alternative support.\n\nNatasha will ensure all work is completed and properly documented for handoff.\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to work together and wish you success with your projects.\n\nBest regards,\n[Manager]\"\n\n**Protection Measures:**\n- Keep all communication documented\n- Screenshot all work delivered\n- Track all hours precisely\n- Have Natasha summarize each day's accomplishments in writing\n- Be prepared to provide evidence if payment disputed\n\n**Red Flags to Watch:**\n- Continued non-response to work submissions\n- Further complaints despite evidence to contrary\n- Requests to work outside contracted hours\n- Any suggestion of payment disputes\n- Escalating hostile tone\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the pattern (demands rejected → behavior deteriorates → silence after reports sent), this client likely needs to be exited unless immediate improvement shown. The management overhead and potential non-payment risk outweigh typical 4-hour contract revenue.\n\nHowever, give 3 days for Iris to course-correct before final decision.\n",
