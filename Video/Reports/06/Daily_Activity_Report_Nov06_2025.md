## 9. DOCUMENTATION GAPS & NEEDS

### Documentation Maintained

## 16. CONCLUSION

November 6, 2025 was an **administrative day** for the Video Department, with focus on employee profile management rather than video production. The department successfully:

- Conducted system-wide audit of Left folders across all 7 departments
- Updated 1 departed employee profile (Panchenko Diana) with correct status
- Identified documentation gap (Polina Nastich missing profile)

**Key Concern**: Only administrative work documented; no video production activities visible. This suggests either:
1. Light workload day focused on administrative tasks
2. Video production work occurred but was not documented
3. Documentation standards not being followed

**Immediate Recommendation**: Implement daily documentation requirements for all Video team members to ensure core video production work is visible and tracked.

**Overall Assessment**: Successful Administrative Day, but Production Work Visibility Needed
**Administrative Tasks**: ✅ Complete (1/1)
**Production Work**: ❓ Unknown (not documented)
**Data Accuracy**: ✅ Improved (1 profile corrected)
**Team Visibility**: ⚠️ Low (no production work visible)
