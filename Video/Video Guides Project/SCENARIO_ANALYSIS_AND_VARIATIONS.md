# Video Guide Scenarios - Deep Analysis & Variations

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Analysis Based On:** Department Guides + Employee Work Data from Nov25 Folder  
**Purpose:** Refine and optimize 77 video scenarios with data-driven variations

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

After analyzing the department guides (Video, AI, Design, LG) and employee work examples, I've identified key insights that should shape our video guide creation:

### Key Findings:

1. **Real-World Complexity** - Actual workflows are more nuanced than the original 77 scenarios suggest
2. **Tool Integration** - Employees use 5-10 tools per workflow (not just one)
3. **Skill Progression** - Clear beginner → intermediate → advanced paths exist
4. **Cross-Department Dependencies** - Most work requires collaboration across departments
5. **AI Integration** - AI tools are embedded in nearly every workflow now

### Recommendations:

**Instead of 77 standalone scenarios, consider these approaches:**

---
