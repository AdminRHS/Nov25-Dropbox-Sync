**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Marta wrote to me, maybe she'll come back. Like Karlsson, right? Sweet, sweet. She'll come back.

She said she really liked yesterday's task that she was working on. She liked it? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. She even wanted to reconsider quitting, well, to hold off for a minute, right.

So she totally quit? No, no, she'll only work on projects, like two hours on the call, but won't work for now. Because of wage arrears, right. Wait, you could do that? Well, basically yes, sort of, yes.

The school saves money, they won't pay for two extra hours, work and go. I see. My kitty.

And we want to eat. There's a Perplexity agent working for me, right. It rewrites Twitter comments for me, dozens a day.

I immediately got excited that yesterday they wrote to me about the same project in DK, which has existed for several years already. It curates artists, like that. Well, such artists, suitable ones, who are, in general, I don't know how to say, a bit with LGBT vibes, with a touch of... all that stuff.

The main thing, of course, is that the artists, they are... such proper artists. Yesterday they write to me, we want to hold with you... Well, it's such an event where a person or a group of people gathers there, and they can be asked any questions, they answer. They invited me as part of several artists to participate in this.

Wow, yes. Such a community, such a project. And it wasn't created by the artists themselves, they say it's backed by Bill Gates' foundation, but for artists, it's for them.

And what are you proposing? To answer questions. A questionnaire, right. Yes, only in live form.

Like that, here's the post. Yes, then they added me to this list. We'll sit in the sound theater, either asking each other or answering commenters' questions.

And I, and the most interesting thing is that I don't even know who wrote to them so much that they noticed me. Right. I didn't do the outreach myself.

It was the agent. I'm asking it. First I scrolled through my page, didn't find who commented to them.

On your Twitter profile page there are replies where you answered other people. I scrolled through these replies, I don't see who wrote to them. So I wrote to the agent.

Find who you talked to them, what you did. It first also scrolled through my replies on my page, didn't find anything. Then it started scrolling through their page looking for my comments.

And scrolled for a long time, I didn't wait, went to mom's, came back from mom's. And only then did it find a way to see who replied to whom on Twitter. To specific users replied to a specific user.

And there's what it wrote for me. Such a word salad, as they call it. As it's already called in such communities, where there's a lot of word salad.

Such comments it wrote all along. Such a batch it wrote. And that's just for them, otherwise it writes this to everyone.

So. So it wrote, wrote, wrote. And now they told me, I'll have to, can't refuse.

And this is today at 6 PM. I'll leave early. To make it to the sound hour.

And Team Engagement was made for me by artificial intelligence. Well, of course. So, we're doing everything our way.

Oh, I'm falling asleep again. I'll edit the lists. A picture.

Somewhere I lost it again. This is effective. I noticed how it, on Twitter, in the gallery, in secret lists too, wrote in comments, I'm working on a mysterious, on a mysterious project.

In the gallery it replies, can't wait to see what it will be. I tell it, are you crazy? Why are you, for example, writing that I'm working on something I'm not working on? It already made up that I'm working on a mysterious project. Yes.

And well, of course, it writes such word salad, it writes much better than me. Artificial intelligence has already surpassed me. And speaking about the fact that it writes dozens a day, well, the main thing is how many times a day you launch it, it will write several comments. At least it writes this word salad beautifully.

So, I, in short, just cleaned up the info, updated it. Now I'll have to pretend that I talk like this in real life too. It's some kind of list, there are some people, some people aren't there.

How to orient it at all, unclear. And there's no Bykova there, it turns out. Kolya will come now.

Well, really, I think, probably in this case, to get out of this situation, we probably need to give those leads a task to fill this out. I don't see other options. And we also, by the way, probably don't have a list of all employees at all, specifically designers.

Probably not. For all the frames of open policy we'll get there. Hello.

Hello. Yes, we were dealing with project people again. Clients are being difficult without a fight, just everyone.

What and how? Domains again? No, I mean, very greedy. For example, Marta's client, we set the price at a thousand something for two people, for full-time. And he writes, no, let's do 900, as it was, it's too expensive.

900, as it was. Two people and two. We don't have such prices.

Part-time costs 1200 or something like that, one designer costs. And he has two working. He's like, no, let's do this later.

Or offer one lead gen on part-time. Well, but he wants two, well, he has one lead gen crying, and the second designer is our Marta, right, but they do basically more or less the same work. That, the black gentleman? No, no, that's a different one.

This one, he's been working with us for four or five years. Another Iris, who complained that our Natasha works on the project. They called, contacted Natasha.

She, turns out, as Nastya said, came to Kolya, said that she wants us to boost her subscribers. Well, and Kolya told her that, well, like, for us, like, to subscribe from our lead gen to her channel, it costs, like, two dollars, I think, he told her, per one subscriber or something like that. She said, no, yes, it's too expensive, let's lower the price.

He says, but I, he says, not less, I don't agree. So Kolya, damn, is right, well, really. So then what she did, she then writes, I can't understand at all how Natasha works for me.

Natasha works there with overtime. I can't understand how she works. They called Natasha, she says, she doesn't answer me there and so on.

Natasha says, she wrote to me yesterday at 15:03, I answered her at 15:07. She asked, Natasha, are you here, are you online? I write to her, yes, like, in four minutes I'm online. In the end, she then answered her in the next message at eight in the evening and wrote to our services, why doesn't Natasha answer her at eight in the evening.

How strange, right? Yes, because she works from 12 to 4. Why should Natasha answer her at eight in the evening, right? She wanted this way, apparently, you know, to pressure us to lower the price on these subscribers. This morning there was another such commotion. Well, it happens.

Yes, yes, yes. And there's that. And this, we climbed around with Roza, sat since morning.

And then I went into this list, I'm looking already, I was looking yesterday too, I think, I forgot, if I didn't remember. And again the data doesn't match. It's incorrectly marked who's on a project, who's not on a project.

Let's go through and mark it. Let's do it, yes. And do you have a complete current list at all, where it would be clear who's on a project and who's not on a project? Well, something's going on with the records, comrades.

Well, I also said that, of course. Let me, I know who's sitting. Now I'll make a selection by surname for the guys.

Here. And purely for ours. I think, probably, it will be easiest for those leads to go to the task and say who else is completely on the list.

Let's go, I'm ready. So, let's go, then. Now.

Uh-huh. So, you need both project people and non-project people. Let's go through the list by surname.

Let's go. Yes, Melessi Beruk, I don't know, he's in a suspended state for us. He most likely won't return.

Do you need resigned ones or not? All, goodbye, he's not there. All, not there. Let's move on.

Safonova Leonora, we have this one, and she's available. Safonova Leonora. Yes, there is.

She's with us. She works for us. Let's also check rates right away.

Rates meaning full-time? Yes. Let's go, okay. Let's move on.

All, we close Safonova. Next. Shemkevych, Iryna.

How should we mark them now? Can we go through one list? Through yours. No, I just have it from TRM. I'm writing like this.

Or let's make it so that those who work should be available for us directly. Full-time or part-time. Like that, maybe, I suggest doing it.

First of all. Who needs to write something. Here.

On the name of these, or what, these folders? I'm just now, you tell me, Safonova, she's in the middle of the list for me. Then there will be Glushko now, then Teslenko, then Bagun and so on. If we put someone here, then... Who should be deleted at all? No, everything's different there.

Everything's different. Then let's do it your way. Yes, let's go.

This Eleonora is there, yes? Next we have Shemkevych, Iryna. She's available for us, yes. Such a girl here.

And everyone works during the day for you, right? You don't have evening shifts? Yes, only I sort of have the evening shift, the rest mainly work during the day, yes. So, next we have Glushko. Was she there for us? Yes.

She's full-time on a project now. That's when they divided Russian, not Ukrainian, right. One, yes, full-time project.

Is there, yes? Yes, yes, yes. Next Bagun Polina. Bagun Polina, yes.

She's part on project, part for us. Just part-time, rate, show rate. One in total turns out.

One, yes. I just don't know how to set this rate. How many can you take? 0.5? 0.5? Well, although it's clear that if part-time and part-time, then it's clear.

Well yes, okay, okay, next. Yes. Next Chabatar Yulia.

Such one, yes. Yes, yes, yes. There is.

Then Bykova Anastasia. There's a complicated situation with her. She doesn't even have granny, I think, right? There is granny, she doesn't have a profile.

She is currently listed on a project. Right. And today she should have a call with the project, but when she doesn't have a task, she works for us.

And it's unclear what rate she works for us at, right? Well, no, well, most often, just sometimes we tell her, if this client something comes in, then we say, you do for the client first, and then for us, right. Because the client, once she worked completely for us for 3 days there. But officially she was listed on the project, because the client now went somewhere to some conference, and said, I'll return on Friday, and we'll discuss.

So, today it's unknown how she'll work, well like either for us or for him, right. Like that. Will be written.

Bykova Anastasia. Next. Yes, Bykova Anastasia.

She works here and there. Let's move on. Shtepa Yulia.

She has full-time project. And there it was written that she's available. Today they talked with her, it seems.

There was a question whether they'll remove her from the project or not. It seems like for now the client is satisfied. Next we have.

Shelep Olga. Exactly the same, there it was written, available, but she's on project. Full-time.

Uh-huh. Then next. Syrotyuk Maria.

I don't think I even saw her on the lists. There's no such one. Yes, yes.

Rare where? Rare where? Send me how she's written in English. Now, now. So, Syrotyuk Maria.

Among designers? Designer, designer. I'm not just a designer, I don't know the others. I can send you after the designer.

Yes, here. So, street. That is, what I can, like, but edit exactly for supporters I know, yes.

Because we already encountered with video editor, and exactly the same, when we checked all video interviews, it was terrible, it was some kind of hell. Here. Because there are no lists.

We checked, of them six we personally found who are no longer in our company, but they're listed on the lists. And among them there was someone, from Tomina was there even. There was even a test Olya account, which is in CRM.

Here. And like we verified with Hiring Living, with channels, with all the rest, and it's unrealistic to get a list. Well, some really truthful one, you see.

Here. So, oops. We don't have one place where everything would be marked at once.

Olya, hello. Hello. Hello everyone, yes.

Dasha made yesterday evening, she showed me, I just didn't have enough energy to run through. Well, she made an official file completely with all statuses, rates, who for how much and so on. But she put it in accounting, she just doesn't know.

Well, she has access to all folders, if you tell her where to put it, where it will be, well or what prompt. She updated this information yesterday, just so you know. Better to go through and... Probably, yes? Probably for sure.

While I'm writing the prompt, can you write to Dasha to ask her to share this file with me? Share the file to AAI? Well, somewhere, yes. To AAI is possible. There's not everything yet, Kol.

There, probably, maybe it's still early. Here actually need to add not only Syrotyuk, but everything else.]

**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Kolya, for a second I want you to look at me again. Where am I connected from? Go lower.

So, now, I'll turn it on for the ninetieth time. I think I have admin credentials. So, where to look where it's from? Connected.

Slice, login. Can't see it. Choose higher.

I'm clicking on the top button. Open or Copy. Opening.

Browser with FWE inserts search bar. Authorize. Yes, go in.

Where? In cursor, everything's ready. Now copy this link from the top. Ah, this one.

Yes, there open it nearby. Nearby where? Right here? Yes, here in the FWE browser. Authorize, again.

Copy this code here and paste it into cursor. Click Continue. Done.

Now let's check, maybe you don't have Git Bash installed yet. Now it will say. How to check? Need to wait.

Now it should load us a window. Or click on the gear again. On the right side.

It's opening, everything works. Aha, well good. No need, you have everything.

And here we set plane mode, right? Uh-huh. Aha, well good, done, thank you. And thank you too.]
