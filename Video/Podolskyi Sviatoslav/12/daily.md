**Whisper Flow Transcript:**

[Hello. To be honest, I was born in fantasy, pressing the card and throwing it in. She says, what is this, what is this, what is that? This Chronicle Bot, damn.

What is this? And what's this Chronicle Bot? I don't know yet what Chronicle Bot is. I don't know. The one that wrote yesterday, I don't understand, today there's a call or something, I also don't really understand, yes.

They're with Artemchuk, I wanted to call Artemchuk then so he could explain. There they write all kinds of things in admin, all kinds of stuff. Yes, basically, Sveta, I saw a message yesterday about, I don't understand, today's a call, or is it not a call, or what is it, he distributed some tasks directly, yes.

So. First of all, they're going to introduce a bot that will check in Discord how much time you sat in channels. When you logged in, when you left.

Also they want, basically, now they're strictly introducing time tracking checks and attaching screenshots from the rest, accounting will introduce, in connection with these power outages. So. And how this bot works, I don't know yet.

And now there's also this some kind of bot, I don't understand, we only have a call today at 11, or we don't have it, yes. Nothing is clear. Kolya is here, Kolya, I understand, is not in the best mood today, because yesterday I left around one-thirty, and he was sitting in the channel.

And from one-thirty he still hadn't gone to sleep. I don't know. That's his business, Kazan delay.

I don't understand what he's writing here. Now I'll ask Artemchuk. They also published it, like everyone should immediately understand what this is.

It looks different for everyone. No, no, just the very fact of what this is and so on. Something red, something critical, high priority, ongoing, production operations one.

I'll read the details, because Vil's earliest call was scheduled for 11 o'clock. And where can this be seen? And there's also time listed until some hour. Look, there at the bottom Wednesday 16.01 hour.

This, I think, is our call, what this is, unclear. Everything is written out there, what will need to be said. Well yes, so I don't know.

Well, this they pulled out, I understand, from our reports. Yes, it's clear that this is generated. Projects, infrastructure, work processes.

Maria Glushko, power outages, determine infrastructure support options, coworking, acquiring basic client feedback. This is exactly what I was saying. We already solved this problem.

Check Maria Glushko's project. Schedule immediate client check. Work completed without feedback.

This problem was also already solved. Zoho platform research. We've only just started this.

Complete research, testing companies for new client. Basically, based on our reports it pulled out some nonsense, that's all. Black Friday company, high priority this week.

And why high priority? I didn't say this was high priority. Okay, this week like create 3 free days for advertising. Prepare for negotiations with Mosik about Marta's rate increase.

Is a robot writing this? Based on our reports? It's not Mosik working on the project, it's Storyboards. Replacement I am, that's clear. Data mining analysis in connection with client for more accurate project scope expansion.

Polina's contract will complete all work by the 13th hour. Hand over to developers, she won't make it. We already discussed this.

Standard talismans the same thing. She will provide design system analysis in honor of comments received after review. Strictly defined colors, missing components.

Tool setup, availability. Migration from Adobe Firefly Pro and Dropbox for all designers. Well okay, Dropbox, clear, migration.

And what's with Adobe Firefly? What migration? Frequency of client communication. Incorrect circumstances related to inclusion in electronic. Basically, nothing.

Some nonsense. Well, I calculated Vil's. Now I'll calculate yours approximately.

Critical. Infrastructure, training. First, training video about file system.

You just somehow, you know, didn't make it. It should be like everyone else's. This green, yellow variation.

So, I also have green, yellow, red here. This is critical. Only for everyone, you know, it's nicely done.

Like from a new line. For you everything's in a row. Yes.

Just there's some kind of event above. See, it's written. Video operating review from 17 to 18.

I like it. And the finance department will be from 18 to 19. So, okay.

I calculated Vil's. It's clear that nothing is clear for you. Training video about file system.

What is this? Basically, complete editing and provide to lead generators for adaptation. What training video are you making? What training video? Leave against-lists from more than 8 upcoming videos CRM, OpenAI, creating free production. Problems of transportation influence, power outages, evaluating captives and employees, coordinate with finance department infrastructure support, EcoFlow, coworking.

And see, they're suggesting. Yes. Production process optimization, analysis of people's places related to power outages and development of clear procedures.

Notifications to clients about delays, client video process performance, balanced work completion deadlines with clients main priority, functional tasks, using tools for video, analyzing effectiveness of best, practices for Runway, gigensynthesis, video production standards, ensuring standard quality system, subtitles level sound optimization platform, key process for checking 18-step, video production workflow when creating training video, workflow integration tools and protocol for responding to given circumstances of client interaction. Nothing is clear? Basically. And yours is even worse than what we saw.

This robot is making something up, based on what we talked about somewhere somehow, made up some nonsense. How? Like it made up a plan. So should we pull Dasha's out now or not, warn her about this, about power outages from sitting in Discord.

I was just about to, and she got disconnected. Just sitting, and now she's appeared again. Yes, it's so nice to hear.

Considering that yesterday they didn't make this folder for the eleventh day, I sat and made the folder and made a separate report based on my conversations. And there it needed to be separate. Now they'll create all folders inside themselves.

Yes? Yes, Kolya said, Artemchuk, that all folders inside Discord, Dropbox, are created independently and add here basically these three template files. Every day we create a folder ourselves and add our three reports there. Someone got tired of doing this, yes? Kolya Artemchuk wanted to do this, but Nikakar told him that like I won't bother anyone within the framework, like let them do it themselves, so there aren't empty folders.

He likes when empty folders like-that like created and immediately filled them. So, Dash, I'm telling you, something is planned for us, Svetushka said, regarding there will be like this flexible schedule, yes, will be in connection with power outages, but with checking work hours. Now they'll implement a bot in Discord, how much you sat in chats, when you logged in, does your login match with CRM and so on.

And plus the same thing they'll strictly check, most likely they'll add more screenshots to the CRM system. Yes. Just so you're aware.

For now they're still in the implementation stage, I don't know, but they'll check both login and logout, basically, when we left and all that. Okay. The main thing is that there are 8 hours and work is done, right? Yes, the main thing is that there are 8 hours.

The only thing, at least the plus in all this, is that they allowed us sort of flexible schedules, because the guys, some have everything ok, but mainly those in the east, everyone has some problems with this electricity. So. The worst situation for them.

And most importantly, that work is completed, screenshots are attached, accordingly, and this now, if new bots come out, there will either be more screenshots, or there will be some bot in Discord that will look at who worked how much, when they logged in, when they left and so on. That is, basically, time will need to be tracked, actually, now both in Discord and in Timetracker. Ok.

Uh-huh. We're informing you. But they're still in the development stage, all this business.

That is, it's unknown how it will be. There's also written, need to talk to Olya, or what they came to. I don't know about Olya, but... So.

That's how it is, that's how. This is what we wanted to say. And also, Dasha, there's a new client coming.

Yesterday there was a new client, some woman from America. And she'll need like videos. She has, I understand, some kind of her own company, and she does email newsletters.

And, possibly, most likely, she'll need, like, some video inserted into this email newsletter. Or maybe she'll need some videos. So.

If anything, we'll call you to Design Studio. Okay, if needed, then ok. Well we don't know, like she wanted a designer who would do all this, but if suddenly, that is, like, it's unknown what she needs in this video.

That without a video editor there's no way, yes. Well, okay. And who else is there? Yes, are you doing video interviews? Well, yesterday I finished what I had here, yes.

This thing, how is it? Basically, finished yesterday's. The non-Russian. The non-Ritu girl.

Ah, that Alicia. There need to... He wrote to me that they've been waiting since August for some young lady. Ah, I was also looking, yes.

And the fact that we asked them for the list back in September, when we were compiling here. But she wasn't there. What's most interesting, she wasn't on the list.

Yes, give us the list. They only just put her, I understand. Want me to, although she seems like she's listed since August but she's first in line.

How could we miss her? Listed where? They've been waiting since August for us to make her a video. Yes, liquidate. Yesterday we got attacked in chat.

We've been waiting since August, where's the video for the joiner. Did they go crazy or what? We went through the table, made all the videos. Yes, and we can't get a list of employees from them, neither joiners nor anyone.

How many? Two months we've been fighting, nothing at all. We've already rechecked this list 10 thousand times. And now they've been waiting since August supposedly.

That's what they wrote. And we've also been waiting for how long specifically from you for a list, so we can check everything in a single table. And nobody provides it to us.

If they had at least written we've been waiting since August, could have just come in and said, there, guys, you probably forgot about the video, please make it, and there would be no questions. But instead, we've been waiting since August supposedly. We also wait for super great candidates for 300 dollars to edit motion design, do everything else.

How long have we been waiting? We've been waiting since the company's founding. And for them to work overtime and so on. And with all the AIs.

And be super specialists. And with all the nerves. Yes, yes, yes.

Also waiting. And we're waiting for the list. Okay, we won't fulfill candidates together, but we're waiting for the list, waiting.

And how many times they did it for us, we already redid this list with Artemchuk two or three times for these reports. Basically, probably need to make that young lady, so they don't cry there. Well okay, but we checked with you, remember, last week.

We sat, roughly speaking, manually. Checked each one by number. Moreover, it turns out half of them haven't worked for a long time, although they were listed.

10 people minus years don't work. Well yes. Turns out, there's still not everything there.

You know, other people's mistakes are always noticed better than your own. In this case it's easier to blame than to do. So that's how.

Exactly the same as with me. Urgently, urgently make this Dalmatian, there was something like that. My power isn't working since yesterday.

Dinochka. Let's go. Dovladdadova.

Got it. Understood. Dovladdodova, yes. Chipolina doesn't work, Dovladdodova doesn't work.

Chipolina, yes. Most interestingly, her name is Nastya Polina. We call her Nastya and Polina.

She's actually called something different. We call her Nastya and Polina. It sounds so funny to me.

To me too. According to my schedule now there should be no power, and my power should cut out right now. I have no power.

Three times a day. You have a tablet, yes. Yes, I have a tablet, but still you feel it's not the same.

For me in some cunning way something was figured out here. Someone threw some wire somewhere. Well, if I suddenly disappear.

So what, Mom, you don't appreciate that my Visa turned off. Yes, I want to talk more with these. And do we have many guys here who are in Ukraine, who get all this turned off? Well, in our department somehow it turned out that we have you and we have one more girl from Dnipropetrovsk region, Kamenskaya, I think, also.

Oh, one girl, apparently. Oh, there it's just trouble, trouble, trouble. Yes, but with him... She's also working on a project.

Well, then she needs to be simpler, probably, although... The rest of us Leonora is in Germany, Irina in the Netherlands, our other girl you worked with, Polina, she's in Austria. So... It's normal there. And Yulia is heard, when she starts talking, you hear people talking around.

Are you sitting in a cafe somewhere? Me? No. No, not you, it's the second Yulia. Ah, no.

Yulia, maybe, yes, I don't know. My microphone was turned off, and now I'm, yes, in a cafe. No, I just hear that you have... Yes.

No, we're fine. Yes, all good. Just, turns out, I live with my girlfriend, she also has remote work, and she has a very important call.

It sounds at our place, if such calls coincide, some through hands, we're one in one. Here's a quiet hotel, I have a cafe under my building. Yes.

Yes, we also have Bykova Nastya, the same, she's somewhere in Western Ukraine, and, by the way, I don't know, she's in Odessa, said it's normal there. Well, judging by what's happening in Odessa. It's already catastrophe there.

Well, in principle, people have adapted to everything already. Well, still, when it turns off, you still sit, so what should I do? Well, of course, it slows everything down a bit, everything's a bit slow. But then, of course, when power turns on, also.

They turned on power? There was no power from 11 AM to 6 PM. At six-thirty they turned on power, at 9 they turned it off. What was I supposed to manage to do in that time? Not do laundry, not wash dishes.

Ah, also we had, basically, yesterday these, turns out, we have, well, something there, basically, in the basement, I don't know, was going, basically, something flowing somewhere, in the basement water is knee-deep. Well, water is really standing. And because of this they turned off water.

And yesterday we had this, even though they turned on power, and we had a bit more time between outages, there, well, 3-4 hours, well, but we sat without water. So you say you won't do laundry, nothing, but then they turned on water, and after 20 minutes they turned off power. Well, and, naturally, again water.

Well, basically, could just live, as they say, well. Well, you'll laugh, but I have... But you all still complained. Gas is the only thing left.

Listen, I have... Well, we have, thank God, well, we have, what is this, we did renovation, we have in the kitchen this from spark. But there's no spark. So we, like old good, match, and Vadik, and you wait, and that's it.

And I have a different joke. I told you how my valiant cat caught a mouse? And yesterday Vika came home, mine opens the trash can, as she squeals, another mouse. Well, the cat somehow played weakly, but caught this mouse himself.

Well, and not arriving, just caught gloves there, basically. Interesting, where are they climbing from to you? Threw from balcony. Want a joke? Vika, well, already there late evening opens trash can, no longer squeals.

Says, Svyat, there's another one sitting. She says, it just scurried, ran away. No, they climb through... through the riser, through pipes.

Well, imagine, if this is already the third, then, sorry, there's already one sixth. God, we still need wild mice, Lord. Well, basically, in general, my cat was on duty all night today, I don't know what he was doing there.

Well, good job. But didn't catch mice. He urgently needs to get a second one.

He at least scared them away, you know, with his scary appearance. For mice. So, here, basically, need this favor... Timilolu... Timilolua favor.

Favor Timilolua. This she's Zimbabwe for someone... Ay, plague! Is she for someone Zimbabwe before us, or what? Nigeria, probably, some, I don't know. Basically, she's also pre-sale, she's pre-sale.

Pre-sale manager. Personnel assistant. This is her, so, as manager Rozhavenkiy works, yes? Yes.

I'll throw her into the table at the very first, or what, let her be. And I was, basically, was in Lviv. That's all days.

And what? Does anyone there know anything about power outages? Nothing. Everyone generally lives their beautiful wonderful life. We lived there, there was, basically, water, and heating, and power, and internet, and connection.

Generally it was wonderful there. Great. And then, naturally, I was struck by only two moments from all this.

Well, first, I didn't hear, because well, it was a festival, and I, basically, with children made her. If anything, the greatest achievement she managed to make a design system for that website. Ah, design system for that website.

Check what stage she's at. Apparently, won't make it, so, as an option. Design system.

So, also need to pull Nastya here, probably, because need to decide what's with Polina, because she has a day off today. Nastya, remember, we cruelly removed you from your workplace. What's with Polina, with Data Mining project? Anything known? Because she only works on it today and tomorrow.

I don't remember anything. Wrote. Yes, not visible yet.

We have some call now. Did you know that today all day calls in every department? I knew, yes. Because that's what they told me.

We have questions about Polina standing there. Polina is at work. Yesterday she was.

We don't know anything that she there... Yesterday argued, today the situation could change. Don't know anything. Before that still need to connect interns about this website.

I barely caught him yesterday. When he can be caught today, I don't know. At least we'll still do feedback, all that.

We generally agreed with him yesterday about a call, but he had it at 11, I suggested to him 3 o'clock. He froze me out. But I wrote today.

I'm sensing this for the first time. Maybe they accidentally did it? Well, maybe, I don't know. We'll find out.

You also have such a story. Because for now, you have chaos in folders. Well, then okay.

Regarding the client I'm not very aware. What about the website? He only worked on the presentation. She worked on it full-time.

And wouldn't even get to the presentation. Add what needs him most. In principle, she said normally, adequately.

He didn't say anything there. She liked the client, in principle.]

## Notes
- **Critical Priority**: Complete Alicia's video interview immediately - client waiting since August (unacceptable delay)
- **Time Tracking Changes**: New Discord bot will monitor channel presence, login/logout times - must ensure 8 hours tracked and work completed
- **CRM Requirements**: More screenshots may be required to verify work during flexible schedules
- **Chronicle Bot Review Needed**: AI-generated summaries contain inaccuracies and misunderstandings - need manual review
- **Polina Deadline**: November 13th is final day for Data Mining project - must confirm status today
- **Infrastructure Reality**: Eastern Ukraine team (Dasha, Maria) experiencing severe disruptions; Western/European team (Leonora Germany, Irina Netherlands, Polina Austria, Nastya Odessa) working normally
- **Personal Challenges**: Team members dealing with power outages, water shutoffs, basement flooding, pest problems while maintaining professionalism
- **Folder Management**: Daily self-created folders with three template files now required in Discord/Dropbox
- **Video Interview Backlog**: Need to verify complete list accuracy to prevent future "waiting since August" complaints
