   - Raise topic diplomatically at appropriate moment (after discussing video feedback)
   - "We want to make sure our communication meets your expectations"
   - "What's the best way for us to get timely feedback from you?"
   - "How quickly should we expect responses on deliverables?"
   - "Which communication channels do you prefer - email, Slack, other?"
   - Listen actively to their perspective and constraints

3. **Document Agreement in Real-Time**
   - Take notes during call or use Whisper Flow to record
   - Write down agreed-upon communication protocols
   - Note specific response timeframes committed
   - Clarify what requires immediate response vs. can wait
