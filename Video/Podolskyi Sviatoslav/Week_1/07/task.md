## Task 4: Resolve Client Pricing Negotiation for Marta's Project

### Steps:
1. Review current pricing structure: 1000 for two full-time workers
2. Document client's requested reduction: 900
3. Calculate actual costs and determine minimum acceptable rate
4. Prepare justification for maintaining 1000 rate
5. Identify alternative options (reduce to one full-time worker, change scope)
6. Schedule call/meeting with client to discuss
7. Present pricing rationale and alternatives
8. Negotiate final agreement
9. Document agreed-upon terms

### Resources and Links:
- Current client contract
- Company pricing guidelines (part-time = 1200, full-time rates)
- Marta's project history and performance data
- Client communication history

### Instructions:

**Pricing Analysis:**
- Current ask: 1000 for two full-time workers (Marta + lead gen)
- Client wants: 900
- Difference: 100 (10% reduction)
- Per person rate at 1000: 500 per full-time worker
- Per person rate at 900: 450 per full-time worker

**Note:** Company part-time rate is 1200 for one person, so two full-time at 1000 is already a significant discount.

**Negotiation Talking Points:**
1. Current pricing (1000 for two full-time) is already below market rate
2. Individual part-time rate is 1200, so client is getting 2 full-time workers for less than 1 part-time
3. Both workers deliver equivalent quality work
4. Alternative: Offer one full-time lead gen at 600 (part-time rate equivalent)
5. Alternative: Keep both workers but reduce hours proportionally to reach 900

**Communication Strategy:**
- Schedule call with client in next 24-48 hours
- Lead with value delivered (quality of work, responsiveness, results)
- Present pricing rationale clearly
- Offer alternatives rather than flat rejection
- Be prepared to walk away if client is unreasonable

**Fallback Positions (in order of preference):**
1. Maintain 1000 for two full-time workers (ideal)
2. Offer 900 for reduced hours across both workers (acceptable)
3. Offer one full-time worker for 600 (acceptable if client agrees to reduced scope)
4. End engagement if client insists on 900 for same work (not profitable)

## Task 6: Review and Audit AI Agent Twitter Activity

### Steps:
1. Export or review all comments the Perplexity AI agent has written
2. Categorize comments by type (engagement, self-promotion, community building)
3. Assess which comments align with your personal brand and which don't
4. Identify the "mysterious project" comment and similar fabrications
5. Determine acceptable vs. unacceptable types of AI-generated content

### Instructions:

**Audit Process:**
1. Use Twitter's reply search feature or the method the agent used to find your comments
2. Review at least the past week of AI-generated comments
3. Note particularly good examples (authentic-sounding, valuable engagement)
4. Flag problematic examples (invented projects, overly generic "word salad")

**Key Issues to Address:**
- AI agent claiming you're working on a "mysterious project" when you're not
- Ensuring comments are relevant and valuable, not just "word salad"
- Maintaining authenticity while using automation
- Balancing quantity (dozens per day) with quality

**Adjustment Recommendations:**
1. Reduce frequency from "dozens per day" to more sustainable amount (maybe 10-15)
2. Add constraint: Do not mention projects unless specifically documented
3. Focus on genuine engagement rather than promotional content
4. Add review step: Flag comments for your approval before posting if they mention your work
5. Provide AI with accurate list of current projects to reference

**Guidelines for Future Use:**
- AI can engage with others' work authentically
- AI should NOT invent projects or activities
- Comments should add value to conversations, not just seek attention
- Limit promotional content to actual accomplishments
- Review AI activity weekly to catch issues early

## Task 10: Establish Process for Real-Time Employee Status Updates

### Steps:
1. Identify all systems that currently track employee status
2. Determine which should be the "master" source of truth
3. Design workflow for status updates (who updates, when, how)
4. Create single update form/interface that propagates to all systems
5. Document the new process in team handbook
6. Train team leads and administrators on new process
7. Set up automated reminders for regular status reviews
8. Implement audit system to catch future discrepancies
9. Schedule monthly review of process effectiveness

### Resources and Links:
- Current systems: TRM, CRM, Hiring Living
- Potential automation tools (Zapier, Make, custom scripts)
- IT department for integration support
- Team handbook/documentation repository

### Instructions:

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The current problem exists because:
- Multiple systems track employee data separately
- No single source of truth
- Updates made in one system don't propagate to others
- No defined owner responsible for accuracy
- No regular audit/verification process

**Proposed Solution:**

**1. Designate Master System:**
Choose one system (likely TRM or HR system) as the authoritative source. All other systems should sync from this source, not the other way around.

**2. Single Update Workflow:**
- Create web form or dedicated interface for status updates
- Form includes: Employee name, new status, effective date, reason for change, updated by
- Submission triggers updates to all connected systems
- Confirmation email sent to submitter and employee

**3. Assign Data Ownership:**
- Designate specific person (HR manager or operations manager) as "data owner"
- Team leads can request changes, but data owner makes official updates
- Clear escalation path for urgent changes

**4. Regular Review Schedule:**
- Weekly: Team leads review their team status
- Monthly: Full audit of all employee data across systems
- Quarterly: Process review and improvement discussion

**5. Automation Opportunities:**
- Auto-sync between systems where possible
- Automated alerts when data mismatches detected
- Scheduled reports showing recent changes
- Warning flags for employees not updated in 30+ days

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Week 1: Choose master system and data owner
- Week 2: Design and build update form/interface
- Week 3: Set up automation and syncing
- Week 4: Train team leads and administrators
- Week 5: Launch new process with monitoring
- Week 6-8: Gather feedback and refine
- Month 3: First quarterly review

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero data discrepancies between systems
- All employee status updates completed within 24 hours
- 100% team lead participation in weekly reviews
- Reduced time spent on manual verification
- No more surprise discoveries of inactive employees in systems
