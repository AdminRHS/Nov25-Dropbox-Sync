   - Confirm client has WordPress experience or prefers easy-editing solution
   - Establish timeline: target completion by November 18, 2025

3. **Developer Coordination (Stas):**
   - Verify Stas's availability and current workload (he was ill recently)
   - Confirm he can handle hosting setup for projects
   - Clarify technical specifications needed from clients before he can proceed
   - Establish communication protocol (text-based task descriptions, not just calls)

4. **Documentation:**

### Instructions:

**Execution Priority**: HIGH - Begin immediately, target completion November 8-10, 2025

**Primary Owner**: You (coordination role) with Nastya, Polina, and Stas

**Process**:
1. **Day 1**: Contact Nastya to check client response status; contact Polina to clarify scope details

3. **Day 3**: Create project briefs and confirm timelines with all parties
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor progress and remove blockers

**Key Decision Points**:
- **Platform selection**: Recommend Storyblock for clients who want easy editing without WordPress experience; WordPress for clients with existing WP knowledge
- **Scope management**: Be firm about timeline impacts if client expands scope beyond 6 pages + templates
- **Pricing**: Client cost sensitivity noted in daily.md - ensure any additional costs are communicated early

**Communication Protocol**:
- All task assignments to Stas should be in writing (he requested text-based TZ/specifications)
- Client questions should be consolidated to minimize back-and-forth
- Set specific response deadlines when sending client questions

## Task 3: Resolve Client Communication and Scheduling Protocols

### Steps:
1. **Document Current Issue:**
   - Natasha Litvinova on Iris project (12:00-16:00 working hours)
   - Client call scheduled during project time creates conflict
   - Part-time/project-only contracts don't compensate for non-project administrative time
   - Team frustration about unpaid time spent on coordination calls

2. **Research Current Policies:**
   - Review existing employment contracts for part-time staff
   - Identify compensation structure (project-only vs hourly vs hybrid)
   - Document current practice for handling calls/meetings outside project work

3. **Draft Policy Proposal:**
   - **Availability Windows**: Part-time staff must specify availability windows outside project hours for client calls
   - **Scheduling Rules**: Client calls cannot be scheduled during committed project time unless emergency
   - **Compensation Options**:
     - Option A: Part-time staff compensated at hourly rate for non-project calls (increases costs)
     - Option B: Client calls scheduled only during non-project hours (limits flexibility)
     - Option C: Hybrid - short calls (<15 min) uncompensated, longer calls compensated
   - **Notice Requirements**: Minimum 24-hour notice for client calls; 48-hour notice preferred

4. **Stakeholder Input:**
   - Gather feedback from affected team members (Natasha, other part-time staff)
   - Consult with accounting/HR on compensation implications
   - Review with client success team on feasibility

5. **Finalize and Communicate:**
   - Create written policy document
   - Distribute to all part-time and project-based staff
   - Update client communication templates to include availability expectations
   - Train team leads on enforcing policy

6. **Implement Tracking:**
   - Create system to log non-project time spent on calls/admin work
   - Integrate with existing time tracking (mentioned CapCut tracking timer in daily.md)
   - Monitor compliance and adjust policy as needed

### Resources and Links:
- Current employment contracts (part-time staff)
- Time tracking system documentation
- HR/accounting contact: Katya (mentioned in daily.md)
- Existing client communication guidelines
- Example policies from other departments or companies

### Instructions:

**Execution Priority**: HIGH - Complete by November 8, 2025

**Primary Owner**: You (policy creation) with input from HR and affected team members

**Process**:
1. **Immediate Action** (Day 1): Document Natasha's specific case as example; reschedule her call to before 12:00 or after 16:00
2. **Policy Draft** (Day 1-2): Create initial policy proposal with 3 compensation options
3. **Stakeholder Review** (Day 2-3): Get feedback from team, HR, and finance
4. **Finalization** (Day 3-4): Select best option based on budget and team morale
5. **Communication** (Day 4-5): Distribute policy and train team leads

**Key Considerations**:
- **Cost Impact**: Compensating for non-project time increases labor costs; consider impact on project profitability
- **Team Morale**: Current situation causing frustration; uncompensated time feels unfair
- **Client Expectations**: Clients may expect flexible availability; need to set clear boundaries
- **Competitive Practice**: Research what other companies in industry do for part-time contractors

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero scheduling conflicts within 2 weeks of policy implementation
- Part-time staff satisfaction with compensation structure
- Clients understand and respect availability windows
- Clear time tracking for all non-project administrative work
