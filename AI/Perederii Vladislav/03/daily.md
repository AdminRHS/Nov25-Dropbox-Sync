#### **Detailed Daily Report**

**What was accomplished on Friday: Strategic breakthrough – from approval to first results in one day**

Last Friday was a turning point for the new project. Phenomenal results were achieved, turning the idea into a tangible asset:
1. **Got the green light from management:** The plan and structure of the Google Maps scraping project were successfully presented and received full approval, confirming its strategic importance.
2. **Immediately implemented a key milestone:** Immediately after approval, a specialized script for collecting negative reviews was developed and launched. This resulted in the collection of a **unique dataset of over 1,000 real negative reviews**, which is an invaluable asset for training and tuning the future analytics system.
3. **Infrastructure stability ensured:** Financial issues with Google Cloud were resolved, and the flagship "Deep Research" automation system successfully passed another real-world test.

**What's planned for today: A strategic pivot in one project and building the "brain" in another**

Today is a day of deep intellectual and technical work. The plan consists of two key areas:
1. **Strategic reconfiguration of job site scraping:** A paradigm shift will occur – **from quantity to quality.** Instead of collecting every job posting, preparatory work will be carried out for focused scraping of only targeted, relevant professions for the company.
2. **Building the analytical core of the "Google Maps" project (Main Focus):** This is the main task of the day. Based on the dataset collected on Friday, a "problem dictionary" will be created – the intellectual foundation of the entire system. Immediately after this, the remaining code will be written and assembled to perform the analysis and generate the final lead table.

**Challenges and Blockers:**
* **The main challenge is the technical complexity of the code for the Google Maps project.** Writing a script that correctly analyzes the data, calculates metrics, and combines all steps into a single `main` file is a complex task that requires careful work with data (Pandas), analysis logic, and possibly basic NLP tools (nltk).
* **Secondary Task:** Preparing filters on job sites is monotonous but important preparatory work that may take longer than expected.
