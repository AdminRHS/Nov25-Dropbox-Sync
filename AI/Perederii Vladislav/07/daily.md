#### **Detailed Daily Report**

**What was done yesterday: Final code "hardening" and full pre-release readiness**

Yesterday was dedicated to transforming the working code into a reliable and optimized tool. Key improvements were achieved that brought the project to the pre-release stage:
1. **Scraper stabilized:** The "Reviews" button search function was significantly improved, solving one of the main issues causing crashes.
2. **Intelligence core enhanced:** The "Problem dictionary" was expanded again with dozens of new "anchors," increasing the accuracy of NLP analysis.
3. **Decision-maker search optimized:** The key person search logic was improved, which directly impacts the value of the final result. 4. **The platform for the "combat" launch has been prepared:** The system has undergone multiple tests, and a list of relevant industries for today's work has been prepared in advance.

**What's planned for today: "Baptism of Fire" Day – from final improvements to the first real launch**

Today marks the culmination of the entire project. The plan consists of three key, sequential phases:

1. **Final R&D Improvements:** An attempt will be made to achieve another qualitative leap by integrating AI into the LinkedIn profile search process and conducting a final iteration of semantic analysis improvements.

2. **Team Sync:** A final meeting will be held with end users – lead generators – to approve the list of target industries. This will ensure that the first "combat" run is as relevant as possible.
3. **First "production" launch (Maiden Voyage):** The most important stage. The system will be launched for the first time on real data, approved by the team, to obtain the first practical results.

**Challenges and Blockers:**
* **The main challenge is the complexity of implementing AI in LinkedIn search.** This is a non-trivial R&D task. The result is not guaranteed, and it may require significant time to experiment with prompts.
* **Secondary Risk:** During the first "production" launch on a large volume of real data, new, unexpected stability or performance issues may be discovered that were not apparent in the test samples.
