- **Tools:** Analytics tools, CRM data, performance tracking systems

**Context:** LG department is under critical evaluation for potential restructuring or elimination to save $5,000/month. Declining appointment volumes despite automation improvements. Need to determine if issue is strategy vs. people. Deep dive research required before making organizational decisions.

**Steps:**
1. Analyze current LG performance metrics and historical trends
2. Review appointment scheduling volume and conversion rates
3. Interview Burda Anna and Shkinder Kseniia on existing strategies
4. Research best practices for lead generation in recruitment industry
