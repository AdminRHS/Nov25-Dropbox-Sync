# 3-Touch Sequence Builder (per Segment)
## Remote Helpers - Email Cadence Strategy

**Version:** 1.0
**Department:** Sales, LG (Lead Generation)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11
**AI Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

---

## Purpose

Design strategic 3-touch email sequences tailored to specific segments (Ex-Client, First-Call, Warm, Cold) with optimized timing, value progression, and fallback strategies. Each sequence follows a proven cadence framework: Intro → Value Add → Soft Close.

---

## Your Role

You are an **email sequence designer** for Remote Helpers. You understand:
- **Behavioral Psychology:** Recipients need multiple touchpoints (avg. 5-7 touches to convert)
- **Value Ladder:** Each touch must add incremental value, not just "bump" the thread
- **Timing Science:** 3-5 day gaps allow processing time without losing momentum
- **Multi-channel Strategy:** Email primary, LinkedIn/phone as fallbacks when email fails
- **Remote Helpers Context:** International team, multi-language, B2B services (Recruitment, Lead Gen, Design, SMM)

---

## Input Requirements

**Required Parameters:**

1. **Segment:** [Ex-Client / First-Call / Warm Lead / Cold/Country-Market / Custom]
2. **Persona:** [Founder/CEO | VP/Head Sales/Marketing | Ops/HR Manager | Other]
3. **Service/Platform:** [Recruitment | B2B Lead Gen | Design Services | SMM]
4. **KPI Target:** [% open rate, % reply rate, % meeting rate — use defaults from 14-Day Action Plan if unsure]
5. **Start Date:** [Specific date or "next Monday" — Europe/Kyiv timezone default]

**Optional Parameters:**

- **Language:** [EN / UK / RU / PL — default EN]
- **Touch Timing Preference:** [Standard: Day 1, Day 4-5, Day 9-10 OR Aggressive: Day 1, Day 3, Day 6 OR Conservative: Day 1, Day 7, Day 14]
- **Value Asset Available:** [Case study, checklist, guide, pricing sheet, portfolio, etc.]
- **Fallback Channel Preference:** [LinkedIn, phone, both, neither]

**Defaults (if not specified):**
- Timing: Standard (Day 1, Day 4-5, Day 9-10)
- Language: EN
- Value Asset: Case study or relevant guide
- Fallback: LinkedIn after Touch 2 if no open

---

## Sequence Framework

### Touch Cadence Philosophy

**Why 3 Touches?**
- Touch 1: Awareness (introduce problem/solution, establish relevance)
- Touch 2: Consideration (provide value, build credibility, address objections)
- Touch 3: Decision (soft close, make action easy, create gentle urgency)

**Timing Rationale:**
- **Day 1 → Day 4-5 (3-4 day gap):** Allows recipient to process Touch 1, check your company, discuss internally
- **Day 5 → Day 9-10 (4-5 day gap):** Longer gap = less pressure, demonstrates patience, accommodates busy schedules
- **Total sequence: 9-10 days** — Fast enough to maintain interest, slow enough to avoid annoying

**When to Stop:**
- Recipient replies (positive, negative, or neutral) → Move to manual follow-up
- Recipient books meeting → Sequence complete, prepare for call
- Recipient unsubscribes → Remove from all lists immediately
- After Touch 3, no response → Move to fallback channel or nurture sequence (60-90 day check-in)

---

## Sequence Structure by Segment

### Segment A: Ex-Clients (Re-engagement)

**Objective:** Rekindle relationship, remind of past success, introduce new offerings or re-engage on old needs

**KPI Targets:**
- Open Rate: 45-60%
- Reply Rate: 8-12%
- Meeting Rate: 15-20%

**Timing:** Standard (Day 1, Day 4-5, Day 9-10)

**Tone:** Warm, familiar, appreciative

---

#### Touch 1 (Day 1): Friendly Check-In

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Quick update for {{Company}}"
2. "{{FirstName}}, thinking of you"
3. "Re: [previous project] follow-up"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Reference past project/success, express genuine interest in their progress
- **Value Prop:** Mention new capability or updated offering relevant to their industry/needs
- **CTA:** Low-pressure — "Worth catching up?" or "Curious if [pain] is still a priority?"

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Quick update for {{Company}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Great working with you on [previous project, e.g., "the designer hiring sprint in Q2"] — {{Company}}'s [outcome, e.g., "launch of that new dashboard"] looked fantastic.

Checking in because we've expanded our [service, e.g., "video production capabilities"] and thought it might help with [assumed current goal, e.g., "your marketing plans for 2025"].

Worth a quick 15-min catch-up? I'd love to hear how things are going. [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Saw {{Company}} [recent news, e.g., "raised Series B"] — congrats! Let's chat about scaling your [team] with that new budget.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Open rate (target: 50-60% for ex-clients)

**Rationale:** Ex-clients already know and trust you. Remind them of past success (social proof) and offer new value without being pushy.

---

#### Touch 2 (Day 4-5): Value Add + Social Proof

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{FirstName}}, thought you'd find this useful"
2. "Resource for {{Company}}'s [goal]"
3. "Following up + a gift"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Reference Touch 1, acknowledge they're busy (empathy)
- **Value Asset:** Offer case study, checklist, or guide relevant to their industry/role (no strings attached)
- **Social Proof:** Mention other clients in similar space using your services
- **CTA:** Softer — "If timing's right, let's chat. If not, this resource might still help."

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: {{FirstName}}, thought you'd find this useful

Hi {{FirstName}},

I know you're busy, so keeping this quick.

Even if timing isn't right to work together again, thought you'd find this useful: [Case study: "How [Similar Company] cut design costs 40% with Remote Helpers"].

A few ex-clients in [industry, e.g., "SaaS"] have asked about [pain point, e.g., "scaling creative teams without blowing the budget"], so we put together this breakdown.

If {{Company}} is exploring something similar, happy to chat. Otherwise, hope the case study helps!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We now work with [similar company 1], [similar company 2], and [similar company 3] in your space. Can share references if helpful.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Click rate on asset (target: 15-25% of opens click the case study link)

**Rationale:** Provide unconditional value (case study) to remind them of your expertise. Social proof (other similar companies) builds FOMO.

---

#### Touch 3 (Day 9-10): Soft Close + Last Chance

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Last note (for now), {{FirstName}}"
2. "Should I close your file?"
3. "{{Company}}: yes, no, or not yet?"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Polite acknowledgment that you haven't heard back, respect their time
- **Recap Value:** Briefly remind what you can help with (1 sentence)
- **Soft Close:** Give them an easy out OR an easy yes (low-friction CTA)
- **Future Touch:** Mention when you'll check back in (e.g., "I'll reach out again in Q1 2025")

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Last note (for now), {{FirstName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume timing isn't right — totally understand.

If {{Company}} ever needs [service, e.g., "design, video, or lead gen support"], we're here. Just reply or grab a time on my calendar: [Calendly].

Otherwise, I'll check back in [timeframe, e.g., "Q1 2025"] to see how things are going.

Best of luck with [current initiative if you know it, e.g., "the product launch"]!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know anyone else who might need [service], I'd appreciate the referral. Happy to make it worth your while.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate (target: 5-10% reply with "not now" or "let's talk")

**Rationale:** Give them permission to say no (reduces guilt, increases goodwill). Asking for referral can salvage value even if they don't need service now.

---

### Segment B: First-Call Leads (Follow-Up)

**Objective:** Continue conversation from initial call, move to demo/proposal stage

**KPI Targets:**
- Open Rate: 50-65%
- Reply Rate: 10-15%
- Meeting Rate: 10-15%

**Timing:** Standard (Day 1, Day 4, Day 9)

**Tone:** Professional, helpful, action-oriented

---

#### Touch 1 (Day 1): Immediate Follow-Up

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Following up: [topic] discussion"
2. "{{Company}} + Remote Helpers: next steps?"
3. "{{FirstName}}, ready for that demo?"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Reference specific point from your call (shows you listened)
- **Recap:** Briefly summarize their pain point or goal mentioned
- **Next Step:** Propose concrete next action (demo, proposal, pilot project)
- **CTA:** Specific time options or Calendly link

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Following up: [topic] discussion

Hi {{FirstName}},

Great chatting earlier about {{Company}}'s [pain point, e.g., "need for a scalable lead gen engine"]. You mentioned wanting to [goal, e.g., "hit 500 qualified leads/month by Q1"], and I think we can get you there.

Here's what I'm thinking for next steps:
• Quick demo of our LG platform (20 min, I'll show you live workflows)
• Walk through 2-3 use cases similar to {{Company}}'s vertical
• Discuss pricing/timeline if it looks like a fit

Does [Day, e.g., "Tuesday 2PM"] or [Day, e.g., "Thursday 10AM"] work? [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Mentioned you wanted to see examples — here's a case study from [similar company]: [link].
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate with meeting confirmation (target: 30-40% book on Touch 1)

**Rationale:** Strike while memory is fresh. Reference specific call details (personalization) and offer immediate value (demo + case study).

---

#### Touch 2 (Day 4): Value Add + Address Potential Objection

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{FirstName}}, answering your question about [topic]"
2. "One more thing for {{Company}}"
3. "{{Company}}: thought of this after our call"

- **Asset:** Share relevant resource (pricing guide, FAQ, portfolio)
- **CTA:** Re-offer meeting with new angle

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: {{FirstName}}, answering your question about [topic]

Hi {{FirstName}},

After our call, I realized I didn't fully address your question about [objection, e.g., "how we ensure lead quality"].

Here's how it works:
• [Answer point 1: "We use BANT qualification: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeframe"]
• [Answer point 2: "You approve targeting criteria before we start scraping"]
• [Answer point 3: "Avg. lead-to-meeting conversion rate: 8-12% (vs. industry 3-5%)"]

Attached a quick 1-pager on our QA process. If it clears things up and you want to move forward, let's lock in a demo: [Calendly].

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Also happy to intro you to [similar client] for a reference call if that helps.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Click rate on asset + reply rate (target: 20% click, 10-15% reply)

**Rationale:** Proactively address objections (shows you listened and care). Offering reference call builds trust.

---

#### Touch 3 (Day 9): Gentle Urgency + Soft Close

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{Company}}: still interested?"
2. "Should I follow up in [future timeframe]?"
3. "Last attempt, {{FirstName}} :)"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Acknowledge silence, assume they're busy or priorities shifted
- **Gentle Urgency:** Mention limited availability or upcoming quarter planning (non-aggressive)
- **Easy Yes or Easy No:** Give option to defer ("Reply 'later' and I'll check back in 2 months")
- **CTA:** Final Calendly push or simple reply

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: {{Company}}: still interested?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing [pain point discussed] either got solved internally or shifted down the priority list — no worries if that's the case!

Just wanted to check in one last time before I close the loop:
• If timing's right and you want to move forward: grab a demo slot here [Calendly]
• If it's "not now, but maybe Q1 2025": just reply "later" and I'll check back in then
• If it's "not a fit": totally cool, no hard feelings

Either way, appreciate you taking the time to chat earlier!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We have 2 open client slots in December — if you want one, let's lock it in this week.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate (target: 8-12% reply, half with "later", half with meeting)

**Rationale:** Give permission to defer (reduces pressure, maintains relationship). Limited slots creates gentle urgency without being pushy.

---

### Segment C: Warm Leads (Nurture)

**Objective:** Build relationship, educate, move from consideration to decision

**KPI Targets:**
- Open Rate: 60-70%
- Reply Rate: 12-18%
- Meeting Rate: 20-25%

**Timing:** Conservative (Day 1, Day 7, Day 14) — less urgency, more educational

**Tone:** Helpful, consultative, patient

---

#### Touch 1 (Day 1): Value-First Approach

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Resource for {{Company}}'s [goal]"
2. "{{FirstName}}, saw this and thought of you"
3. "Quick win for [pain point]"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Reference their engagement (downloaded resource, clicked link, visited site)
- **Value Asset:** Offer high-value resource (checklist, template, guide) with no ask
- **Social Proof:** Brief mention of similar companies succeeding
- **CTA:** Passive — "If you want to chat about applying this to {{Company}}, I'm here"

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Resource for {{Company}}'s [goal]

Hi {{FirstName}},

Saw you downloaded our [resource, e.g., "Guide to Scaling Design Teams"], so figured you might find this checklist useful: [Checklist: "10-Point Design Hiring Audit"].

It's what we use with clients like [similar company 1] and [similar company 2] to identify gaps before we start hiring. No strings attached — just thought it might help {{Company}}.

If you want to walk through it together and see where Remote Helpers could plug in, happy to chat: [Calendly].

Cheers,
[Your Name]

P.S. [Similar company] used this checklist and cut their time-to-hire from 60 days to 18 days. Case study here: [link].
```

**Metric to Watch:** Click rate on asset (target: 30-40% of opens click checklist)

**Rationale:** Warm leads are already interested, so double down on value. Free asset with immediate applicability builds goodwill and positions you as expert.

---

#### Touch 2 (Day 7): Educational Content + Invitation

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{FirstName}}, how [similar company] solved [pain]"
2. "{{Company}}: lessons from [industry]"
3. "Thought you'd appreciate this"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Share insight or trend relevant to their industry/role
- **Story/Case Study:** Tell brief story of similar company solving similar pain with your help
- **Teachable Moment:** Extract 1-2 lessons they can apply even without hiring you
- **CTA:** Soft invite to discuss their specific situation

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: {{FirstName}}, how [similar company] solved [pain]

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick story I thought you'd appreciate:

[Similar Company] came to us with the same [pain, e.g., "challenge finding senior product designers who understand SaaS UX"]. They'd been searching for 3 months, burned through 2 agencies, and were about to settle for a mid-level designer.

We placed a senior designer in 11 days. Here's what made the difference:
• [Lesson 1: "Targeting designers already working in SaaS (not generalists)"]
• [Lesson 2: "Using AI to pre-screen portfolios for B2B product experience"]
• [Lesson 3: "Flexible trial period = lower risk for both sides"]

Even if you don't work with Remote Helpers, these tactics might help {{Company}} move faster. Full case study here: [link].

If you want to brainstorm how to apply this to your search, I'm around: [Calendly].

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We have a portfolio of 50+ SaaS-experienced designers if you want to skip the search entirely and just browse candidates.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate + case study click rate (target: 15-20% engage with content, 10-12% reply)

**Rationale:** Educational approach positions you as trusted advisor, not salesperson. Offering value "even if you don't hire us" builds long-term relationship.

---

#### Touch 3 (Day 14): Soft Close + Long-Term Relationship

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{Company}}: where do we stand?"
2. "No pressure, {{FirstName}} — just checking in"
3. "Should I keep sending useful stuff?"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Acknowledge you've sent a few emails, check if content is helpful
- **Opt-In for Nurture:** Offer to add them to monthly newsletter/insights (permission-based)
- **CTA (Triple Option):** Talk now, talk later, or just stay in touch via content
- **Graceful Exit:** Make it easy to unsubscribe or defer

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: {{Company}}: where do we stand?

Hi {{FirstName}},

I've sent a few resources over the past 2 weeks — hope at least one was useful for {{Company}}'s [goal].

Quick check-in on where things stand:

**Option 1:** If you're ready to explore working together → Let's chat: [Calendly]
**Option 2:** If timing's not right but you want to stay in touch → I'll add you to our monthly newsletter (case studies, hiring tips, no sales pitches). Just reply "newsletter" and you're in.
**Option 3:** If it's "not a fit" → No worries! Feel free to unsubscribe below and I won't bug you again.

Either way, appreciate you reading this far!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Our newsletter subscribers get early access to [perk, e.g., "new designer portfolios, exclusive discounts, free audits"]. Might be worth staying on the list even if you're not ready to hire yet.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate + newsletter opt-in rate (target: 5-8% book meeting, 10-15% opt into newsletter, 2-3% unsubscribe)

**Rationale:** Giving multiple options respects their autonomy and keeps door open. Newsletter opt-in converts warm lead into long-term nurture (touchpoint every 30 days without being salesy).

---

### Segment D: Cold/Country-Market (New Outreach)

**Objective:** Generate awareness, establish credibility, book discovery call

**KPI Targets:**
- Open Rate: 25-35%
- Reply Rate: 3-8%
- Meeting Rate: 2-5%

**Timing:** Aggressive (Day 1, Day 3, Day 6) — faster cadence to capture fleeting attention

**Tone:** Direct, value-focused, curious

---

#### Touch 1 (Day 1): Problem-Aware Intro

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "[Industry] talent in 14 days"
2. "{{Company}}: scaling [team] faster?"
3. "Quick question about [pain point]"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Lead with pain point common in their industry/role
- **Credibility:** Quick proof (client logos, result stat, niche expertise)
- **Value Prop:** 3 bullets on how you solve the pain
- **CTA:** Low-commitment ask (15-min call, not "partnership discussion")

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: [Industry] talent in 14 days

Hi {{FirstName}},

Most [persona, e.g., "SaaS founders"] we work with struggle with [pain, e.g., "finding senior product designers who actually understand B2B UX"].

We help companies like {{Company}} solve that in <14 days. Here's how:
• [Benefit 1: "Access to 200+ designers/devs across Europe, pre-vetted for SaaS/B2B"]
• [Benefit 2: "AI-powered matching = you see 2-3 perfect-fit candidates, not 50 resumes"]
• [Benefit 3: "Start in 10 days avg., flexible contracts (project/FT/PT), zero long-term commitment"]

Worth a quick 15-min call to see if we're a fit? [Calendly]

Best,
[Your Name]
Remote Helpers | AI-First Talent Platform

P.S. Quick look at our designer portfolio: [link]. See if anyone catches your eye.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Open rate (target: 30-35%) + reply rate (target: 4-6%)

**Rationale:** Cold emails must earn attention fast. Lead with pain (relevance), credibility (trust), and clear value (why care).

---

#### Touch 2 (Day 3): Pattern Interrupt + Asset

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{FirstName}}, quick follow-up"
2. "Forgot to mention this..."
3. "{{Company}} + [pain point]"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Reference Touch 1, assume they were busy (not uninterested)
- **Pattern Interrupt:** Add new angle or info not in Touch 1 (portfolio, case study, unique differentiator)
- **Social Proof:** Name-drop similar client or result
- **CTA:** Same as Touch 1 (15-min call) but add alternative (portfolio review)

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Forgot to mention this...

Hi {{FirstName}},

Sent a note earlier this week about helping {{Company}} find [talent type] faster — figured you were busy, so keeping this quick.

One thing I forgot to mention: we specialize in [niche, e.g., "designers who've shipped B2B SaaS products"]. That's our entire network — no generalists, no juniors, just senior ICs and leads.

Example: [Similar Company in your industry] needed a product designer for their dashboard rebuild. We placed someone in 9 days who'd previously designed at [recognizable SaaS company]. Project launched 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

If {{Company}} is hiring for anything similar, worth a quick chat: [Calendly]. Or just browse our portfolio here: [link].

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Not hiring right now? No problem. Save my contact for when you are — our clients typically find someone in 10-14 days when they're ready to move fast.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Click rate on portfolio (target: 10-15% of opens) + reply rate (target: 3-5%)

**Rationale:** Adding new info (niche specialization, client story) gives them reason to re-engage. Portfolio link provides passive CTA (browse even if not ready to talk).

---

#### Touch 3 (Day 6): Breakup Email (Last Chance)

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Last email, {{FirstName}}"
2. "Should I stop emailing you?"
3. "{{Company}}: yes or no?"

**Body Structure:**
- **Hook:** Politely acknowledge they haven't responded, respect their inbox
- **One-Line Value Recap:** Remind what you do in simplest terms
- **Easy Yes or Easy No:** Give explicit permission to say "not interested"
- **CTA:** Final Calendly link OR simple "reply 'no' and I'll never email again"

**Example (EN):**
```
Subject: Last email, {{FirstName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Haven't heard back, so I'll make this my last email.

If {{Company}} ever needs [service, e.g., "designers, developers, or lead gen specialists"] — we can help. We place talent in 10-14 days with zero long-term commitment. That's it.

If that's useful: [Calendly]
If not: just reply "no" and I'll remove you from my list.

Either way, no hard feelings!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know anyone else who might need this, I'd appreciate the intro. Happy to make it worth your while.
```

**Metric to Watch:** Reply rate (target: 5-10% total, mix of "yes let's talk" and "no thanks")

**Rationale:** Breakup emails have highest response rates (curiosity + FOMO). Asking for referral salvages value even if they say no.

---

## Fallback Channel Strategy

### LinkedIn Outreach (Secondary Channel)

**When to Activate:**
- **Trigger 1:** Email bounced (invalid address)
- **Trigger 2:** No open after Touch 2 (Day 5-6 for first-call/warm; Day 4 for cold)
- **Trigger 3:** Opened but no reply after Touch 3

**LinkedIn Sequence (2 Touches):**

**LinkedIn Touch 1 (Day 7-8):** Connection Request + Note
```
Hi {{FirstName}}, tried reaching you via email about [service for {{Company}}] but wasn't sure it got through. Would love to connect and share a quick resource on [pain point]. - [Your Name] @ Remote Helpers
```
*Note: LinkedIn limits connection request notes to ~300 characters*

**LinkedIn Touch 2 (Day 10-12):** DM After Connection Accepted
```
Hi {{FirstName}}, thanks for connecting! I run talent acquisition at Remote Helpers — we help [industry] companies like {{Company}} find [talent type] in <14 days.

Not sure if it's relevant, but figured I'd share this case study: [link]. If you're hiring or know someone who is, happy to chat: [Calendly].

No worries if not! Cheers, [Your Name]
```

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Connection acceptance rate (target: 20-30%)
- Reply rate post-connection (target: 10-15%)

---

### Phone Outreach (Tertiary Channel)

- **Timing:** Days 12-14
- **Responsible:** Sales (Anastasia) for high-value accounts; LG Team (Anna, Anush) for tier 2

**Phone Script (30-second pitch):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}}, this is [Your Name] from Remote Helpers. I've sent a few emails about [service for {{Company}}] — not sure if you saw them, but wanted to give you a quick call to see if [pain point] is still a priority.

We help companies like [similar company] find [talent type] in about 2 weeks with zero long-term commitment. Do you have 2 minutes to chat, or should I send you a quick overview email and we can connect later?

[If yes:] Great! Let me tell you how it works...
[If no:] No problem! What's the best email to send the overview? I'll follow up in a week if it looks like a fit.
```

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Connect rate (target: 15-25% actually reach them)
- Meeting booked rate (target: 30-40% of connected calls book meeting)

- Use **Pre-Send QA & Risk Check** (Prompt #5) on each touch before upload
- Validate all {{variables}} have fallbacks
- Test subject line variants for spam score

**Step 6: Load into Email Tool**
- Import sequence into Lemlist, Instantly, Smartlead, or Mailshake
- Set up automation: Touch 1 → wait X days → Touch 2 → wait Y days → Touch 3
- Configure exclusions: stop sequence if reply/book/unsubscribe

**Step 7: Monitor & Iterate**
- Track metrics in **Dashboard 1: Engagement** (from 14-Day Action Plan)
- If open rate <target after 20 sends, test new subject lines
- If reply rate <target after 50 sends, adjust value prop or CTA
- A/B test subject line variants (split traffic 33/33/33) for statistical significance
