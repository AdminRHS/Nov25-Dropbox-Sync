## Context Integration Enhancements

### Intelligent Participant Identification

**Purpose**: Automatically identify participants in call transcripts

**Implementation**:
- Embed relevant employee subset in **department_context** section
- Add identification strategies to **department_instructions** section
- Include confidence level assessment in output format
- Flag unmatched participants for manual review

**Reference**: [docs/01_employee_directory_guidance.md](./docs/01_employee_directory_guidance.md)

**Example Integration**:
```markdown
### Department Employees (from Employee Directory)
- **Shelep Olha** (ID: 86641) - UI/UX designer | Ukraine
- **Bogun Polina** (ID: 87537) - UI/UX designer | Austria
[... remaining Design team members ...]

**Participant Identification**:
- Match names using direct match, contextual clues, and communication handles
- Assign confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Flag unidentified participants for manual verification
```

---

### Intelligent Project Identification

**Purpose**: Automatically identify projects mentioned in transcripts

**Implementation**:
- Include relevant project subset in **project_matching** section
- Add abbreviation recognition
- Enable multi-lingual project name matching
- Reference known resources (Figma, Google Drive)

**Reference**: [docs/02_project_directory_guidance.md](./docs/02_project_directory_guidance.md)

**Example Integration**:
```markdown
### Department Projects (from Project Directory)
- **DGN (Design Studio)** - Design services platform
  - Keywords: Design Studio, DGN, design services
  - Resources: Logo, Google Drive, Figma
- **MDL EU/UA** - Market-specific versions
  - Keywords: MDL, European market, Ukrainian market
  - Resources: Figma designs (old and new versions)
[... relevant projects for department ...]

**Project Identification**:
- Match via direct name, abbreviation, or keywords
- Handle multi-lingual names (Russian, Ukrainian, English)
- Reference known resources when project identified
```

---

### Standardized Vocabulary Application

**Purpose**: Ensure consistent terminology across all departments

**Implementation**:
- Apply standardized action verbs (with action/process/result forms)
- Use department-specific object libraries
- Implement standard status, priority, and complexity values
- Apply RACI matrix for accountability

**Reference**: [docs/03_vocabulary_standards.md](./docs/03_vocabulary_standards.md)

**Quality Standards**:
- All tasks use ACTION + OBJECT + CONTEXT format
- Status values: not_started, in_progress, blocked, completed
- Priority values: critical, high, medium, low
- Complexity values: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert
- RACI defined: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed

---

### Task Template Framework

**Purpose**: Structure all task extraction consistently

**Implementation**:
- Apply ACTION + OBJECT + CONTEXT format to all tasks
- Include complete task metadata (owner, priority, timeline, dependencies, status)
- Use step templates for procedures
- Use checklist templates for verification
- Assign RACI for accountability

**Reference**: [docs/04_task_object_framework.md](./docs/04_task_object_framework.md)

**Example Task Structure**:
```json
{
  "task_name": "Create employee onboarding documentation",
  "format": "ACTION + OBJECT + CONTEXT",
  "action": "Create",
  "object": "employee onboarding documentation",
  "context": "for new employee registration system",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Shelep Olha",
    "department": "Design",
    "profession": "UI/UX designer"
  },
  "priority": "high",

  "related_project": "LibDev / Talents Microservice",
  "raci": {
    "responsible": "Shelep Olha (Design)",
    "accountable": "Nealova Evgeniya (HR Manager)",
    "consulted": ["Development Team"],
    "informed": ["All Department Leads"]
  }
}
```

---

### 21-Section Report Framework

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive, consistent report structure

**Implementation**:
- Integrate full or partial 21-section framework based on call type
- Prioritize sections based on department (see section_mappings)
- Include department-specific sections (16-20)
- Enable cross-referencing across sections

**Reference**: [docs/05_21_section_framework.md](./docs/05_21_section_framework.md)

**Section Selection by Call Type**:

- **QA/Testing**: Sections 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 21
- **Client Calls**: Sections 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 17, 21
- **Department Meetings**: Sections 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, dept-specific (16-20), 21

---

### Department-Specific Customization

**Purpose**: Tailor prompts to department focus areas and workflows

**Implementation**:
- Apply section emphasis from department configurations
- Include department-specific focus areas (3-4 key areas)
- Reference common objects for the department
- Track department-specific key metrics
- Document typical activities and workflows

**Reference**: [docs/06_department_specific_patterns.md](./docs/06_department_specific_patterns.md)

**Department Section Mappings** (MAIN PROMPT sections to emphasize):

| Department | Primary Sections | Focus Areas Count | Team Size |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| HR | 20, 16, 3 | 4 | 2 |
| AI | 8, 9, 11, 3 | 4 | 3 |
| Video | 18, 8, 3 | 4 | 3 |
| Sales | 17, 3 | 4 | 1 |
| Design | 18, 8, 3 | 4 | 9 |

brandbooks, fonts, thumbnails, mockups, wireframes, prototypes, components

### Key Metrics
- Projects completed per week
- Revision rounds per project
- Client satisfaction scores
