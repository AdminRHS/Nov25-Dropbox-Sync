## Tips for Best Results

### Maximize Intelligence Extraction

- **Read between the lines:** Infer unspoken needs from context
- **Track patterns:** Note if this is a responsive vs. ghosting client
- **Assess urgency:** Language like "soon", "urgent", "next week" = hot lead
- **Identify champions:** Who in the client org is pushing for remote hiring?

### Strategic Thinking

- **Think long-term:** Even if they don't hire now, how do we stay top-of-mind?
- **Consider lifecycle:** Could this lead become a multi-year, multi-service client?
- **Spot expansion:** If they hire 1 designer, might they need developers next?
- **Build relationships:** Focus on trust and value, not just closing

### Practical Recommendations

- **Be specific with next steps:** "Send email on Tuesday at 10am CET" not "follow up soon"
- **Provide actual message drafts:** Not just "send them info" but full email ready to send
- **Prioritize ruthlessly:** Not every lead deserves equal effort - focus on quality
- **Document everything:** Capture insights so next sales manager has full context

### Quality Standards

- **Data-driven:** Base recommendations on actual notes, not assumptions
- **Actionable:** Every recommendation should be something you can do today
- **Realistic:** Don't oversell - assess true conversion probability
- **Compliant:** Never recommend contacting opted-out clients
