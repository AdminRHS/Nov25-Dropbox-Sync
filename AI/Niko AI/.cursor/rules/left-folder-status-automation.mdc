ALWAYS automatically update employee profile status to "LEFT" when their folder is moved to or found in a Left/LEFT folder. This is MANDATORY for every detection.

## Left Folder Status Automation Rules

### When to Trigger Status Update
- When a folder path contains `/Left/` or `/LEFT/` in any Nov25 department directory
- When working with or editing Profile files located in Left/LEFT folders
- When user explicitly mentions moving an employee to Left folder
- When detecting Profile*.md files in Left/LEFT directories during any file operations

### Status Update Process

**Step 1: Detect Left Folder Location**
- Check if current file path contains pattern: `Nov25/{Department}/Left/` or `Nov25/{Department}/LEFT/`
- Departments: AI, Design, Dev, LG, Video
- Case-insensitive matching for "Left" folder name

**Step 2: Locate Profile File**
- Search for Profile markdown files in the employee folder: `Profile*.md`
- Profile file naming pattern: `Profile {Profession} {Employee Name}.md` or variations
- If multiple Profile files exist, update all of them

**Step 3: Update Status Field**
- Locate the Status line in Profile file: `- **Status:** [current_value]`
- Replace current status value with "LEFT"
- Format: `- **Status:** LEFT`
- Preserve all other content and formatting

**Step 4: Verify Update**
- Confirm Status field has been changed to "LEFT"
- Ensure no other fields were modified
- Check file formatting remains intact

### File Structure Requirements

**Profile File Format:**
```markdown
## Position

- **Profession:** [profession]
- **Shift:** [shift]
- **Rate:** [rate]
- **Status:** [status]  ← This line must be updated
```

**Status Field Location:**
- Typically found in "Position" section
- Format: `- **Status:** [value]`
- May appear on different line numbers depending on profile structure

### Automation Triggers

**Automatic Detection Scenarios:**
1. **File Path Detection**: When any file operation involves path containing `/Left/` or `/LEFT/`
2. **Profile File Access**: When reading or editing Profile*.md files in Left folders
3. **Folder Operations**: When listing or scanning directories that contain Left folders
4. **User Request**: When user mentions moving employee to Left or updating Left folder status

**Manual Trigger:**
- User explicitly requests: "update status for employees in Left folder"
- User asks: "change status to LEFT for [employee name]"

### Department-Specific Paths

**Base Path:** `Dropbox/Nov25/`

**Department Left Folders:**
- AI: `Nov25/AI/Left/` or `Nov25/AI/LEFT/`
- Design: `Nov25/Design/Left/` or `Nov25/Design/LEFT/`
- Dev: `Nov25/Dev/Left/` or `Nov25/Dev/LEFT/`
- LG: `Nov25/LG/Left/` or `Nov25/LG/LEFT/`
- Video: `Nov25/Video/Left/` or `Nov25/Video/LEFT/`

### Status Values

**Current Status Values (to be replaced):**
- Available
- Project
- Work
- Part Time
- On Leave
- Any other status value

**Target Status Value:**
- LEFT (all caps, as specified)

### Edge Cases Handling

**No Profile File Found:**
- If employee folder in Left has no Profile*.md file, skip silently
- Log action but do not create profile file unless explicitly requested

**Multiple Profile Files:**
- Update all Profile*.md files found in the employee folder
- Ensure consistent status across all profile files

**Status Already "LEFT":**
- If status is already "LEFT", verify and skip update
- No action needed if status is correct

**Profile File Format Variations:**
- Handle different markdown formatting styles
- Preserve existing formatting while updating only Status field
- Support both `- **Status:**` and `**Status:**` formats

### Integration with Other Rules

**Department Logging:**
- After updating status, log action to appropriate department log file
- Follow prompt-saving-rules.mdc format for logging
- Include: Request, Details, Result sections

**File Path Detection:**
- Use department path to determine correct log file
- Example: `Nov25/Video/Left/` → log to `Nov25/Video/Video prompt log.md`

### Examples

**Example 1: Automatic Detection**
- Path: `Nov25/Video/Left/Panchenko Diana/Profile Video Editor Panchenko Diana.md`
- Action: Update `- **Status:** Available` → `- **Status:** LEFT`
- Log: Write to `Nov25/Video/Video prompt log.md`

**Example 2: Folder Scan**
- Scanning `Nov25/LG/Left/` directory
- Found: `Polina Nastich/` folder (no Profile file)
- Action: Skip (no profile file to update)

**Example 3: Multiple Profiles**
- Path: `Nov25/Design/Left/Employee Name/`
- Found: `Profile Designer Employee Name.md` and `Profile Manager Employee Name.md`
- Action: Update Status to "LEFT" in both files

### Important Notes
- Always verify file path contains Left/LEFT before updating
- Preserve all other profile information unchanged
- Update status immediately when Left folder is detected
- Log all status updates to department log files
- Case-sensitive for "LEFT" status value (must be uppercase)
- Case-insensitive for folder name detection (Left/LEFT/left all match)
