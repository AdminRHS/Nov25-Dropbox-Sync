ALWAYS write every user prompt (request) and the result of your actions to the appropriate department log file. This is MANDATORY for every interaction.

Determine the department based on the current file path, open files, or workspace context:
- If the path contains "Nov 25/AI/" or "Nov25/AI/" or working with AI department files → write to /Nov 25/AI/AI prompt log.md
- If the path contains "Nov 25/Design/" or "Nov25/Design/" or working with Design department files → write to /Nov 25/Design/Design prompt log.md
- If the path contains "Nov 25/Dev/" or "Nov25/Dev/" or working with Dev department files → write to /Nov 25/Dev/Dev prompt log.md
- If the path contains "Nov 25/LG/" or "Nov25/LG/" or working with LG department files → write to /Nov 25/LG/LG prompt log.md
- If the path contains "Nov 25/Video/" or "Nov25/Video/" or working with Video department files → write to /Nov 25/Video/Video prompt log.md
- If department cannot be determined from the path → write to /Nov 25/AI/AI prompt log.md (default)

Write my prompts (requests) and the result of your actions to the determined department log file. Add a '----' line above and below the request and the result. Format:
----

**Request**: [User's request/prompt]

**Details**: [What was done, step by step]

**Result**: [Final outcome and summary]
