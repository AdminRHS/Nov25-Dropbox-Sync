---

## Instructions for AI Assistant

### Step 1: Read All Department Prompt Logs

Read the following department prompt log files to collect today's activities:

1. `Dropbox/Nov25/AI/AI prompt log.md`
2. `Dropbox/Nov25/Design/Design prompt log.md`
3. `Dropbox/Nov25/Dev/Dev prompt log.md`
4. `Dropbox/Nov25/LG/LG prompt log.md`
5. `Dropbox/Nov25/Video/Video prompt log.md`

### Step 2: Determine Current Date

Use the system date to determine the day number (e.g., 05 for November 5, 2025).

Format: Two-digit day number (01, 02, 03... 30, 31)

### Step 3: Create Folder Structure

For each department, ensure the following folder structure exists:
```
/Nov25/{DEPARTMENT}/Reports/{DAY}/
```

Also ensure the Admin collection folder exists:
```
/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/
```

Example for day 05:
- `/Nov25/AI/Reports/05/`
- `/Nov25/Design/Reports/05/`
- `/Nov25/Dev/Reports/05/`
- `/Nov25/LG/Reports/05/`
- `/Nov25/Video/Reports/05/`
- `/Admin/Reports/Nov25/05/`

4. Save report to: `/Nov25/{DEPARTMENT}/Reports/{DAY}/Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md`

### Step 7: Copy Reports to Admin Collection Folder

After creating all department reports, copy them to the Admin collection folder with department prefixes:

```bash
cp "/path/to/Nov25/AI/Reports/{DAY}/Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md" \
   "/path/to/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/AI_Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md"

cp "/path/to/Nov25/Design/Reports/{DAY}/Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md" \
   "/path/to/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/Design_Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md"

cp "/path/to/Nov25/Dev/Reports/{DAY}/Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md" \
   "/path/to/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/Dev_Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md"

cp "/path/to/Nov25/LG/Reports/{DAY}/Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md" \
   "/path/to/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/LG_Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md"

   "/path/to/Admin/Reports/Nov25/{DAY}/Video_Daily_Activity_Report_Nov{DAY}_2025.md"
```

### Step 8: Generate Admin Summary Report (Optional)

Create a consolidated summary report in Admin folder that includes:
- Executive summary across all departments
- Total activities count
- Department-by-department highlights
- Overall metrics and statistics
