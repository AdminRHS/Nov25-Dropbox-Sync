## Processing Guidelines

### Participant Identification Protocol

**CRITICAL:** Always attempt to match participants to the Employee Directory (32 employees). Use multiple identification strategies:

**Identification Strategies:**
1. **Direct Name Match:** Match first name, last name, or full name to directory
   - Handle name variations: Nikolay/Nikolai/Mykola, Viktoriia/Victoria/Vika
   - Case-insensitive matching

2. **Contextual Clues:**
   - Department context: If discussing design work, likely from Design department
   - Project context: If discussing specific project, match to known stakeholders
   - Role context: "Our frontend developer" → Check Dev department for Frontend Developers
   - Location mentions: "Our person in Austria" → Rekonvald Viktoriia or Bogun Polina

3. **Communication Handles:**
   - Match Telegram handles mentioned: @twinklelilsta → Artemchuk Nikolay
   - Match email addresses: artemchuknn@gmail.com → Artemchuk Nikolay

4. **Voice/Speech Patterns (if audio clues available):**
   - Language spoken: Chinese speaker → likely Hanan Zaheur (LG, China)
   - Accent/location: Nigerian accent → Archibong Isaac (LG, Nigeria)
   - Professional terminology: Discussing React/TypeScript → likely Dev department

5. **Multi-lingual Name Matching:**
   - Russian/Ukrainian variations: Дарья/Darya, Євгенія/Evgeniya, Михайло/Matvii
   - Handle Cyrillic transliterations

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** Direct name match + context alignment (e.g., "Nikolay from AI team" matches Artemchuk Nikolay)
- **Medium:** Partial match or strong context (e.g., "our video editor Diana" → likely Panchenko Diana)
- **Low:** Weak clues only (e.g., "someone from design" without specific name)

**Output Format for Participants:**
```

### Project Recognition Rules

**CRITICAL:** Always attempt to match project mentions to the Project Directory (31+ projects). Use keyword matching and abbreviations.

**Recognition Strategies:**
1. **Direct Name Match:** Match exact project names
   - "Remote Helpers" → **RH / Remote Helpers**
   - "Design Studio" → **DGN (Design Studio)**

2. **Abbreviation Match:** Recognize common abbreviations
   - "RH" → **RH / Remote Helpers**
   - "DGN" → **DGN (Design Studio)**
   - "l-gn" → **l-gn (Lead Generation)**
   - "trn-s" → **trn-s (Translators)**
   - "d-vs" → **d-vs.com (Developers)**
   - "fv-e" → **fv-e (Video Editors)**
   - "fv-a" → **fv-a (Virtual Assistant)**
   - "of-w" → **of-w (Offline Workers)**

3. **Keyword Match:** Match descriptive keywords
   - "CRM system", "task templates" → **CRM**
   - "lead generation platform", "prospecting" → **l-gn (Lead Generation)**
   - "translation services" → **trn-s (Translators)**
   - "video editing services" → **fv-e (Video Editors)**
   - "WordPress project" → **WordPress Developers**

4. **Multi-lingual Project Names:**
   - "Ты не сам" / "Ти не сам" → **Ty ne sam**
   - "Слайди і плашки" → **RH Video Slides**
   - "Портфоліо проектів" → **Portfolio of Projects**
   - "Стікери на новий рік" → **RE New Year Stickers**

5. **Contextual Clues:**
   - Design resources mentioned → likely has Figma/Google Drive resources
   - SMM content discussion → check for SMM-related projects
   - Client-facing platform → likely one of the service platforms (DGN, l-gn, trn-s, etc.)

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** Exact match or standard abbreviation used
- **Medium:** Keyword match or strong context
- **Low:** Indirect reference or assumed from context

**Output Format for Projects:**
```
**RH / Remote Helpers** - Matched from Project Directory - Confidence: High
**DGN (Design Studio)** - Matched via keyword "design services" - Confidence: Medium
**New Client Platform** - Not in Project Directory - *New project or requires manual mapping* - Confidence: Low
```

**Resource Auto-Referencing:**
When a known project is identified, automatically reference its known resources:
- "RH has Google Drive, Figma work files, and approved SMM posts"
- "DGN has Logo, Old Files, Google Drive, and Figma resources"
