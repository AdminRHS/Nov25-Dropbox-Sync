## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The discussion focused on two main strategic areas: (1) improving the AI onboarding topic by redesigning interview questions to include AI-related assessments (prompt writing, daily recording readiness) and enhancing interview transcription processes with full transcription requests and structured markup formatting; and (2) establishing clear employee working stats protocols for power outage scenarios, requiring Discord presence during all work hours (including evenings/weekends), full work reports, tracker usage, and a communication channel for power outage notifications to responsible parties who can stop trackers. Additionally, a task was assigned to process Tendence export data through AI analysis to generate summaries that can be logged to employee profiles. The strategic direction emphasizes AI-first hiring practices, structured documentation through markup, and resilient remote work protocols that maintain accountability during infrastructure disruptions.

## 6. RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### Communication: Discord Presence During Work Hours
**Category:** Communication

**Rule:** When working during your work hours, even if it's outside standard business hours (evenings, weekends), you must be present in Discord. This applies to all work activities, including make-up work for power outages.

**Rationale:** Ensures team visibility and communication during all work activities. Addresses issue where employees submit reports for evening work but are not visible in Discord, making it difficult to coordinate and verify work activities. Maintains team connectivity and accountability.

**Application:** All departments, all employees
**Enforcement:** Management monitoring, work report verification
**Status:** Established
**Documentation:** Needs formal documentation

### Documentation: Structured Transcription Markup
**Category:** Documentation

**Rule:** Record transcriptions in small chunks with headers and markup between sections. Use markup formatting (horizontal lines, double equals) but prioritize single quotes in separate blocks for code highlighting (creates orange color highlighting). This improves transcription readability and navigation.

**Rationale:** Improves transcription organization and readability. Makes it easier to navigate long transcriptions, identify sections, and highlight important code or technical content. Supports better documentation practices for AI-first organization.

**Application:** HR department, interview transcriptions, meeting recordings
**Enforcement:** Transcription guidelines, quality review
**Status:** Planning
**Documentation:** Needs formal guidelines

### Work Management: Full Work Reports Required

**Rule:** Tracker must be used for all work activities. Tracker should be stopped by responsible party when power outages occur and employee cannot work. Tracker usage continues when work is possible, even during non-standard hours.

**Rationale:** Ensures accurate time tracking for all work activities. Addresses issue where employees work during outages but trackers continue running, leading to inaccurate time records. Supports proper work hour tracking and payroll accuracy.

**Application:** All departments, all employees
**Enforcement:** Tracker monitoring, responsible party management
**Status:** Established (with new outage protocol needed)
**Documentation:** Needs outage protocol documentation

### Hiring: AI-First Interview Questions
**Category:** Hiring

**Rule:** Interview questions must include AI-related assessments: prompt writing capabilities, daily recording readiness, AI tool familiarity. Use company task descriptions to generate targeted questions that better assess candidate suitability for AI-first organization.

**Rationale:** Ensures candidates are properly assessed for AI-first organizational needs. Current interview process is outdated (like 5 years ago) and doesn't evaluate AI readiness. Better candidate assessment reduces hiring costs and improves candidate fit.

**Application:** HR department, AI positions, all positions in AI-first organization
**Enforcement:** Interview process review, question standardization
**Status:** Planning
**Documentation:** Needs interview question guidelines
