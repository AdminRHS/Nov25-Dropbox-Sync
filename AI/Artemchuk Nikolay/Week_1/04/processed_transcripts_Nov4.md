## 4. KEY TOPICS DISCUSSED

### File System Implementation Success with Design Team
Successfully completed first department-wide training on new file system. Design department received hands-on instruction, with all designers installing VS Code and Cursor, learning Whisper Flow transcription with AI-assisted documentation generation. Training demonstrated workflow: record meeting → transcribe with Whisper → paste into file → AI processes and generates structured outputs. Video recording captured for future distribution.

### Lead Generation Department Performance Evaluation
Critical discussion about LG department effectiveness and potential restructuring. Current concerns: data entry focus without strategic value, lack of documented strategies, declining appointment volumes despite automation improvements. Considering whether issue is strategy vs. people. Potential savings of $5,000/month if eliminated, but alternative approach: redirect to strategy documentation and research.

### Structured Weekly Call Rotation Strategy
Proposal to implement systematic bi-weekly department check-ins with structured templates. Suggested rotation: Monday (Design), Tuesday (Automation), Wednesday (LG), Thursday (HR), Friday (Dev), approximately 1-1.5 hours each. Prevents entire days consumed by meetings while ensuring regular touchpoints.

### Project Management Methodology Documentation & Compression
Discussion of creating project examples from successful implementations (File System Project workflow: Describe → Research → Test → Implement → Share). Goal: extract PM structures, create dense prompts using AI compression techniques, research Scrum/Agile frameworks, compress into concentrated documentation.

### CRM Development & OpenAI GPT Assistants Integration
Detailed walkthrough of HR automation using OpenAI GPT Assistants chain: Job Request → Job Template → Post Template → Job Post. Challenges: translation functionality issues, billing/API credit preventing testing ($5 needed). Development focus shifting from frontend to backend since AI can handle presentation layer.

### Short Link System for Prompt Optimization
Need for internal URL shortening system to reduce prompt size. Current problem: long Google Drive/Dropbox links consume excessive tokens. Proposed solution: internal short link management with categorization, automatic forwarding, integration with CRM media storage.

### Old CRM Data Migration Challenges
Critical discussion about migrating historical data, particularly candidate notes and resumes. Solution: AI-powered resume cleaning (remove HTML, images), parsing to auto-fill incomplete fields. Single consolidated "Notes" field proposed for archive with section headers.

### Employee Access Control & Accountability
Implementing individual login requirements rather than shared admin accounts for accountability and audit trails. Personal logins enable proper user management, status tracking, prevent system contamination. User system needs integration with Talents module.

### Microservices Architecture & Development Documentation
Discussion of microservices catalog development and web-based directory. Progress on Task Manager database, prioritizing backend over frontend. Documentation critical: capture Talents development process to replicate for subsequent microservices.

### Training & Onboarding Standardization
Emphasis on creating reusable training content (videos, written instructions, Q&A) cascaded through department heads. Corporate email aliases (name@company.com) forwarding to personal addresses would improve notification reach by 20-30%.

### Version Control & Documentation Standards
Recognition that main prompt and critical documents need version tracking with changelogs. Main prompt now includes version history (2.0 → 2.1) with dated changelog. Should extend to all documents with /version-control subfolder structure.

---

## 5. DECISIONS MADE

### Implement Bi-Weekly Department Call Rotation Schedule
**Decision:** Establish structured bi-weekly calls with each department on specific days for 1-1.5 hours each, with pre-defined templates and goals.
**Rationale:** Current ad-hoc approach leads to forgotten touchpoints and lack of systematic progress tracking.
**Impact:** Affects all departments. Estimated 2-3 hours daily commitment for PM role.
**Implementation:** Artemchuk Nikolay to create calendar-based schedule immediately.

### Redirect Lead Generation Team from Data Entry to Strategy Documentation
**Decision:** Shift LG team focus from manual data entry to documenting strategies, researching approaches, and teaching scraping techniques.
**Rationale:** Current work lacks strategic value and doesn't address root performance issues. Better use during evaluation period.
**Impact:** Changes LG team daily work priorities. Potential future savings of $5,000/month.
**Implementation:** Immediate - starting today/tomorrow. Assigned to Burda Anna and Shkinder Kseniia.

### Transition from Monthly to Daily/Weekly Analytics
**Decision:** Move from monthly statistical reviews to daily/weekly analytics tracking for lead generation.
**Rationale:** Monthly reviews don't provide timely enough feedback for course correction.
**Impact:** Requires analytics infrastructure development, increases data visibility.
**Implementation:** To be implemented this week.

### Prioritize Backend/Database Development Over Frontend UI
**Decision:** For CRM and microservices, focus on database structure and backend logic first.
**Rationale:** AI tools can generate interfaces if backend is solid. Database design more critical for long-term scalability.
**Impact:** Changes development prioritization, creates stronger foundation.
**Implementation:** Already in progress with Task Manager database development.

### Implement Personal Login Requirement (No Shared Accounts)
**Decision:** Require all employees to use personal logins, eliminate shared admin/HR accounts.
**Rationale:** Shared accounts prevent identification of who made changes or caused issues. Personal logins enable accountability.
**Impact:** Affects all employees using internal systems. Improves security and change tracking.
**Implementation:** Already being enforced by Rekonvald Viktoriia for new CRM.

### Progressive Old CRM Feature Migration & Deprecation
**Decision:** Systematically migrate features from old to new CRM one at a time, then disable old features.
**Rationale:** Maintaining two systems long-term is inefficient. Incremental migration allows thorough testing.
**Impact:** Affects HR, LG, potentially Sales departments. Reduces system maintenance burden.
**Implementation:** In progress - Talents module in testing/QA phase.

### Allocate OpenAI API Budget for GPT Assistant Testing
**Decision:** Approve small API budget ($5-20) for testing HR GPT assistant workflows.
**Rationale:** Can't verify functionality without API credits. Investment minimal compared to potential time savings.
**Impact:** Minor financial impact. Enables validation of HR automation workflow.
**Implementation:** Requested from Pasichna Anastasiia (accounting/finance).

### Establish Version Control for Critical Documentation
**Decision:** Implement version control with changelogs for all critical documents, storing current version at top level and archiving old versions.
**Rationale:** Documents evolve rapidly. Need to track changes, understand what was modified, potentially roll back.
**Impact:** Affects documentation practices across all departments. Improves institutional memory.
**Implementation:** Started with main prompt. To be extended to all critical documents.

## 4. KEY TOPICS DISCUSSED

### Automated Daily Planning Workflow Implementation
Team establishing system where call transcripts are automatically processed by AI to generate structured daily plans and task lists. Transcripts captured via Whisper Flow, pasted into daily.md file, AI (Claude via VS Code or Cursor) auto-generates Plans.md and Task.md with priority categorization. Team members only need to paste transcripts - AI handles all formatting and extraction.

### Technical Tool Setup: VS Code + Claude Code Extension
Setting up development environment with AI assistance capabilities. Install VS Code, Claude Code extension from Anthropic, authenticate with Admin Claude account, configure "Plan Mode" (Shift+Tab), use @ mention or drag-drop to reference files. Challenges: Git Bash missing, authentication flow, session limits/credit exhaustion, VPN/region settings.

### Alternative Tool: Cursor IDE Setup
Cursor presented as alternative/complementary tool with similar Claude integration. Install Cursor, disable "Auto" model selection, manually select "Composer 1" model, use Shift+Tab for "Plan Mode". Can install Claude Code extension in Cursor as well. Team tested both and found Cursor slightly faster for this workflow.

### Workflow Standardization Across Design Team
Rolling out to Design team first (pilot). Each team member needs identical setup: VS Code/Cursor + Claude extensions + Whisper Flow. Single standardized prompt for generating plans and tasks. Need simplified instructions (not 1.5 hour setup) for remaining team members. Admin account access coordination required.

### Transcript Quality and Accuracy Concerns
Testing revealed issues with automatic transcription accuracy. Whisper Flow sometimes produces garbled transcriptions. Language switching bug: if English audio detected, entire transcript switches to English. Inaccuracies lead to incorrect plans/tasks. Team needs to validate transcript quality before processing.

---

## 5. DECISIONS MADE

### Standardize on VS Code + Claude Code Extension as Primary Tool
**Decision:** All Design team members will use VS Code with Claude Code extension (Anthropic official) as primary tool, with Cursor as acceptable alternative.
**Rationale:** VS Code widely adopted, free, extensible. Claude Code extension provides reliable AI assistance. Both tested successfully during call.
**Impact:** Design department, future rollout to other departments.

### Use Admin Account for Claude Authentication (Not Personal Accounts)
**Decision:** All team members must authenticate Claude tools using company Admin account, not personal Claude accounts.
**Rationale:** Centralized budget management, prevents unexpected personal charges. Dev team can monitor usage. Previous incident: someone set limit to $200 instead of $20.
**Impact:** All departments using Claude tools.

### Daily Plans and Tasks Generated End-of-Day for Next Day
**Decision:** Generate plans and tasks at end of current day for the following day's work, based on accumulated transcripts.
**Rationale:** Allows processing of full day's information, provides complete context for next-day planning. More logical workflow: reflect on today, plan for tomorrow.
**Impact:** Design department workflow, daily planning process.

### Keep Transcription Simple - Only Paste, AI Does the Rest
**Decision:** Team members only responsible for pasting raw Whisper Flow transcript; AI handles all analysis, structuring, categorization, and task extraction.
**Rationale:** Minimize administrative burden on designers. Leverage AI-first operational model. Allow designers to focus on creative work.
**Impact:** Design department, workflow efficiency.
