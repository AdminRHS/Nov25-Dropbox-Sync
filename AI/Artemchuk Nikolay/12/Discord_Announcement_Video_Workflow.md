# 📢 Important Announcement: Video Transcript Processing Workflow

Hey everyone! 👋

We've set up a standardized **Video Transcript Processing Workflow** that all departments need to follow. This process helps us extract and organize tools, workflows, automation resources, and other valuable information from video transcripts into structured, searchable libraries.

## What This Process Does

The workflow transforms video transcripts into structured data that populates our department-specific libraries. It processes videos to extract:
- Tools and technologies mentioned
- Workflows and processes demonstrated
- Integration patterns and use cases
- Automation resources and techniques

This makes it easy to discover new tools, learn workflows, and stay updated with the latest resources relevant to your department—all without having to watch hours of video content manually.

## Mandatory Usage

**All departments must use their department-specific versions** of these files. Each department has an adapted workflow document and the MAIN PROMPT v4.md file tailored to your specific needs.

## Where to Find Your Files
