**Application:** When processing video transcriptions, assess video size first, then choose appropriate tool

**Examples:** 
- Small videos (< limit): Use Google AI Studio
- Large videos (> limit): Use Transcribe AI
- 8 videos processed overnight using this approach

**Affected Departments:** AI, Video

**Template Integration:** Should be part of Video Transcription SOP

### Perplexity AI Configuration for Lead Generation

**Rule/Practice:** For lead generation content in Perplexity AI: set creativity to 0.5, enable "Structure it out" mode, disable Google Search, enable specific search features below

**Rationale:** Free Perplexity accounts don't work for lead generation, need proper configuration for optimal results

**Application:** Always configure these settings before using Perplexity AI for lead generation workflows

**Examples:** 
- Creativity: 0.5 (not default)
- Structure mode: Enabled
- Google Search: Disabled
- Specific search: Enabled (two items below Google Search)

**Affected Departments:** AI, LG

**Template Integration:** Should be part of Lead Generation Workflow SOP

### Daily Report Processing

**Rule/Practice:** Process daily reports using Claude Desktop with MAIN PROMPT v3 for structured extraction

**Rationale:** Claude Desktop provides better processing than manual review, MAIN PROMPT v3 ensures consistent structure

**Application:** Process all daily reports through this workflow before manual review

**Examples:** 
- Daily reports from previous day processed automatically
- Summaries distributed to team
- Action items extracted for follow-up

**Affected Departments:** All departments

**Template Integration:** Should be part of Daily Operations SOP

### Prompt Organization in Library

**Rule/Practice:** Organize prompts in library structure with proper categorization (Video Transcription, Daily Processing, etc.)

**Rationale:** Proper organization ensures easy access and prevents duplication

**Application:** When creating new prompts, place them in appropriate library sections

**Examples:** 
- Video Transcription prompts in Prompts/Video Transcription folder
- Daily processing prompts in appropriate section
- Review and sort prompts regularly

**Affected Departments:** AI

**Template Integration:** Should be part of Library Management SOP

**Decision Made:** Proposed for future implementation

**Implementation Owner:** AI Department (to be assigned)

**Status:** Proposed

**Documentation Needed:** Discord bot automation requirements

### Problem: Claude Desktop Chat Management

**Description:** Claude Desktop doesn't stop chats properly, continues between chat sessions, making it appear as one long chat instead of separate conversations

**Impact:** AI Department - organization and context management

**Root Cause:** Claude Desktop behavior

**Proposed Solution:** Manage chats manually, organize by moving to appropriate folders (Libraries/Entities level)

**AI Solution Potential:** Could improve with better chat management features

**Decision Made:** Use manual organization, move chats to Libraries/Entities level

**Implementation Owner:** Artemchuk Nikolay (ID: 37226) - AI Department

**Status:** Implemented

## 14. KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS

### Insight: Video Transcription as Foundation for Lead Generation

**Insight:** Video transcriptions can serve as the foundation for generating lead generation content through AI processing, creating a scalable workflow

**Context:** Successfully transcribed 8 videos overnight, creating basis for Perplexity Research workflow

**Application:** Use video transcriptions as input for AI-powered lead generation content creation across all departments

**Related Concepts:** Content repurposing, AI workflow automation, taxonomy extraction

**Impact on Operations:** Enables scalable lead generation content creation, reduces manual content creation effort

**Template/SOP Update:** Should be part of Lead Generation Workflow template

**Department Relevance:** AI, LG, all departments creating lead generation content

### Insight: Tool Selection Based on File Size

**Insight:** Different AI tools have different capabilities and limitations - need to select tools based on specific requirements (e.g., file size)

**Context:** Google AI Studio works for smaller videos but needs Transcribe AI for large files

**Application:** Always assess tool requirements before selecting, have backup tools for edge cases

**Related Concepts:** Tool evaluation, workflow optimization

**Impact on Operations:** More efficient tool usage, better workflow design

**Template/SOP Update:** Add tool selection criteria to workflow templates

**Department Relevance:** All departments using AI tools

### Insight: Prompt Combination for Efficiency

**Insight:** Combining related prompts (video transcription + daily processing) could create more efficient and comprehensive processing

**Context:** Discussion about creating MAIN PROMPT v4 by combining video transcription and daily processing prompts

**Application:** Consider combining related prompts when they serve similar purposes or can benefit from shared context

**Related Concepts:** Prompt engineering, workflow consolidation

**Impact on Operations:** Reduced prompt management overhead, potentially better results from combined context

**Template/SOP Update:** Prompt combination guidelines

**Department Relevance:** AI Department primarily

### Insight: Automated Call Recording Benefits

**Insight:** Manual call recording creates gaps and inconsistencies - automated recording would eliminate these issues

**Context:** Discussion about implementing Discord bot for automatic call recording

**Application:** Implement automation wherever manual processes create inconsistencies

**Related Concepts:** Process automation, error reduction

**Impact on Operations:** More complete documentation, reduced manual effort, better information capture

**Template/SOP Update:** Automation opportunities identification in process reviews

**Department Relevance:** All departments

### Insight: Summary Before Detailed Processing

**Insight:** Creating summaries from transcripts before detailed processing can save time and make communication more efficient

**Context:** Discussion about making summaries from transcripts instead of explaining verbally and then transcribing

**Application:** Always create summaries first when processing transcripts, use summaries for communication

**Related Concepts:** Information hierarchy, communication efficiency

**Impact on Operations:** Faster communication, better information sharing, reduced meeting time

**Template/SOP Update:** Add summary step to transcript processing workflow

**Department Relevance:** All departments

## 15. ANALOGIES & FRAMEWORKS

### "Brick-by-Brick" Workflow Approach

**Analogy:** Breaking down the lead generation workflow into discrete steps (like bricks) that can be assembled

**Explanation:** Each step (transcription → processing → prompt generation → content creation) is a separate "brick" that can be done independently and then combined

**Application:** When designing complex workflows, break into discrete, manageable steps

**Relevance to Remote Helpers:** Applies to all multi-step AI workflows, enables parallel work

**Training Potential:** Could be used in workflow design training
