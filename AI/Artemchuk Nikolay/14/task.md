   - Link to related taxonomy entities (professions, tools, etc.)
5. Create or update taxonomy index to include job sites reference
6. Verify job sites are accessible through taxonomy structure
7. Test that AI can access and use job sites data from taxonomy
8. Document integration approach for future reference
9. Update related taxonomy documentation if needed

## TASK 5: Identify and Fill Information Gaps [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Status:** 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** Ongoing
**Owner:** Artemchuk Nikolay (ID: 37226) - AI Department

### Context:
During the session, a critical issue was identified: there are information gaps where departments work with data for weeks or months, but this data isn't documented in Dropbox. This prevents AI from accessing and using this information. Job sites were given as an example (worked with for 3+ weeks, not in Dropbox).

### What Was Identified:
- **Information Gaps:** Data used by departments but not in Dropbox
- **Example:** Job sites (3+ weeks of work, not documented)
- **Impact:** AI cannot help with information it doesn't know about
- **Solution:** Systematic identification and documentation of gaps

### Steps:
1. **Review Department Work**
   - Identify what each department works with regularly
   - List tools, platforms, data sources used
   - Note duration of use (weeks, months)

2. **Check Dropbox Documentation**
   - Verify if data is documented in Dropbox
   - Check relevant folders and files
   - Identify what's missing

3. **Create Gap List**
   - Document each identified gap
   - Include: Department, Data Type, Duration, Impact
   - Prioritize by impact and frequency of use

4. **Fill Critical Gaps**
   - Start with high-impact gaps
   - Document data in appropriate Dropbox location
   - Follow taxonomy/library structure if applicable

5. **Establish Process**
   - Create process for ongoing gap identification
   - Set up regular reviews
   - Document new data sources immediately

6. **Update Knowledge Base**
   - Add identified data to appropriate locations
   - Update taxonomy if needed
   - Ensure AI can access new information

### Resources and Links:
- **Dropbox Structure:** `Dropbox/Nov25/[Department]/`
- **Taxonomy/Libraries:** For structured data
- **Department Folders:** For department-specific data
- **MAIN PROMPT v4.md:** For documentation standards

### Recommended Approach:

**Gap Identification Process:**
1. Interview each department
2. Ask: "What data/tools do you use regularly?"
3. Check if it's documented in Dropbox
4. If not, add to gap list

**Gap Documentation:**
- Department: [Department Name]
- Data Type: [Type of data]
- Duration: [How long used]
- Location: [Where it should be documented]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

**Filling Gaps:**
- Create appropriate files/folders
- Document data structure
- Add to taxonomy if applicable
- Update indexes

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] All departments reviewed
- [ ] Gap list created and prioritized
- [ ] Critical gaps identified
- [ ] High-priority gaps filled
- [ ] Data documented in appropriate locations
- [ ] Process established for ongoing identification
